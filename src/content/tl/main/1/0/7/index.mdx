# The Journey in Our Memories

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
But dude, if I could go all the way up to the observation floor like you did, I could get the sickest shots ever! Man, I can only dream!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You’ve never been to the Sky Garden?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
Didn’t you hear? They do this crazy background check to make sure you’re rich enough for them before they let you in. No way a guy like me could get in there.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
That’s insane…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
You used to be able to get up there if you just paid 1,000 for a ticket! Man, I really wish I went back then!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah… But when I was a kid, even 1,000 yen was a little out of the question for me, so we weren’t able to go up there by ourselves.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
Seriously? That sucks, for real.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
So we went somewhere else… I think we went to the top of some other building to see the HAMA port…

…Huh? Wait, where was that again…? I don’t remember…!

<p class="t">(Kafka might be there right now…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
……

Whatdja see out there?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Like… the view from that building?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
Yeah. If you can remember anything you saw around there, I might know where it is.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Wait, really?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
Yep! Y’know, I’m trying to be a intergalactic movie director, so I know HAMA better than anyone else in the universe!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He sure is exaggerating a lot…)</p>

Thank you! I’ll tell you what I can remember, so I appreciate all the help I can get!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
Okay! But I’m not gonna help you for free. You gotta be my camera operator for real next time, got it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ahaha… Well, as long as you don’t cause any trouble, I’d be glad to help.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Akuta" name="Boy with Headband">
Aw, hell yeah! I’ll hold you to that!

So, you remember anything?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Uh, well… I’m pretty sure that building had a bento shop on the first floor…

<Bubble mc>
It’s so late…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Are you tired, Kafka?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Yeah.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh? Are you okay?!

<p class="t">(I remember now… Kafka sat himself down in front of that building and didn’t want to move.)</p>

Um, Kafka… Are you hungry? Do you wanna get a bento?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
No…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Then, uh… do you want some water?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m okay.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka…

<p class="t">(I didn’t know what to do, so I…)</p>

<p class="t">(I took Kafka’s hand and led him up the stairs at the side of the building…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah… This is it. It still looks the same…

<p class="t">(I remember that Sakujiro-san was trying to track us down that entire day, and we didn’t find out until afterwards.)</p>

<p class="t">(But in the end, Kafka and I were both able to go on our trip together. We learned how travel can change people’s lives…and we both grew to love HAMA.)</p>

<p class="t">(I worked hard to make this travel guide just because I wanted to make someone smile. I wonder if my job as a tour guide ever made me feel that same way…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider loc="HAMA Ward 3 Building - Staircase"/>

<p class="bg">![Staircase](@/img/bg/00_004_020.jpg)</p>

<Bubble mc>
Haha… These stairs are more narrow than I remember. They looked so much bigger to us as kids.

<p class="t">(Going up these steps holding my travel guide brings back memories of when Kafka and I were doing the same with our hands linked together. I really just…)</p>

I just wanted to see Kafka smile.

<p class="t">(That feeling hasn’t changed, even now, I… No, maybe it’s the opposite now.)</p>

<p class="t">(Those memories taught me that I want to live to make people smile. They made me who I am today. …Hey…)</p>
