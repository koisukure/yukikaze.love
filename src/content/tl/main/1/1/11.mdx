<Bubble character="Ten">
Heyyo, thanks for letting me move in.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…! Ten! W-Welcome to the House.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ah, haven’t seen you in a few days, Renga-san. Didja get home safe?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Y-Yeah. Sorry, I didn’t mean to get so drunk. We’re gonna be roommates here!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
For real? Nice, scored a room with my role model.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Role model…!

&ast;cough&ast; You don’t need to be so formal. We’re fr-fr…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Hm? Can I call you my friend? That’d be awesome.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!!

W-Well! If it helps with my research on the commoner life, I don’t mind being your…uh, fr… Being friends…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
<p class="t">(This guy’s even more gullible than that weird chick…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’ll do you the favor of leading you to our room!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Sweet, thanks. You’re a good friend, Renga-san.

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Looks like everyone’s here. Alright, let’s start our first official meeting as the Morning Team!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(We’ve made it so far in no time at all… Kafka’s amazing.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I was looking through the material… So we’re basically going to be planning a tour package that lets visitors fully explore each region?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
That’s the gist of it. We’ll be making one first as the Morning Team. The Noon Team will be next, followed by Evening, and then Night.

I’m sure you all saw it in the material, but the biggest selling point of our tour packages will be the personalized hospitality provided by each team’s mayors. Each package will have a concept decided by the team leader.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He makes it sound easy, but it comes with a lot. The tour package would become a representation of the leader’s personality.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Even if other aspects of tourism can be copied from one place to another, nobody can replicate human personalities. I assume that’s the foundation of the project.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You pick things up fast, Liguang.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
It was written in the documents for our first meeting. You said that what people are looking for isn’t technology.

And the exact opposite of machinery is humanity.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh…?? Huh…??
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Huh…?? Huh…??
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I don’t think Renga-kun and Yachiyo-kun are following…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
But before we decide on the tour concept, there’s something I’d like to do.

I want us to go on a study trip to strengthen our bonds and do some field research on how tourism works. Every team will be going on these excursions.

I’ll need each team’s conductor and our chief to participate, as well. Yachiyo, that means you, since you’re the Morning Team’s conductor.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ah, ahyeas! Have to write that down… Study trip… Participate… Yachiyo, that means you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
We don’t have time for that! We should just figure out what to do for the tour packages!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
If we do that, our tours will be limited in scope. The study trips will help us understand what people want, and they’ll boost our teamwork as well.

Is this all it takes for you to give up, Renga?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Urk…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Come on, Renga-san. It’ll be fun. I haven’t been on a trip with friends since high school.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!

Uh… Well, if you want to…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(…Huh? Renga-kun caved in. I guess they became friends after having drinks together the other day.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Where will we be going?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
KOBE.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Is that because you’re using KOBE as a benchmark?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Precisely. We have a lot in common with them, and they’re our biggest rival. I want us to adopt what makes them so good.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
That makes sense. I’ve taken inspiration from one of their skaters who has a similar style to mine. Impressive, Kafka. Your way of thinking is nice and flexible, just like the chief’s.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Can you say something that makes sense…?

With that being said, Yachiyo, I’d like for you to arrange our scheduling, accommodations, and transportation.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wah…! Y-You want me to do all of that?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Who else would it be? That’s what I hired you for.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
B-But I don’t know how to do any of that…! Did I write it down somewhere…? Hawawawa…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yachiyo-kun, it’s okay. I’ll be there to help.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I also want us to choose a leader before we leave. Deciding on a tour concept is an important job. I can’t do it, since I already have my plate full with overseeing everyone as Ward 0 mayor.

Any volunteers?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I’d like to, but I’m not sure if I can make time between practice. I’ll offer as much support as I can to make up for it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I’m still new ‘round here, so I don’t think I can do as much stuff as you guys.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
So it comes down to Renga-kun and Liguang-san…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Liguang was in the student council in high school.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, I forgot. You went to <span class="green">Hama Asunaro High School</span> with Liguang-san and Renga-kun, right, Yuki-nii?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Really? That’s the best school in HAMA. You guys must be smart.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Not necessarily. I was admitted through a student-athlete recommendation.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Asu High was big on clubs, right? I heard the sports teams and art clubs did all sorts of crazy stuff.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
That’s true. As a result, a lot of big names from different fields have graduated from there. Their alumni include everything from CEOs to politicians to popular musicians.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Liguang is also working here while inheriting his family business. I think he’d make a good leader.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Hm? Renga-kun looks like he has something to say…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…leader…team.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Hm? What’s wrong, Renga?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…If I can’t be the leader, I’m leaving the Morning team.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…! R-Renga-kun…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’ll be the leader! I can do a way better job than that mophead…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh&ast; This again. You obstinate child…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
We’re the same age, douchebag!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Do what you want. I have no interest in becoming the leader. I’ll do what I have to, and abandon ship if it sinks. That’s the only thing I promised Oguro.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, dammit, hold up, Liguang!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Renga, aren’t you acting a little childish?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…But…!

I… I just…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It’s fine, I was going to pick between the two of you anyway. If you’re volunteering, we can just go with that.

Alright, that’s all I wanted to talk about.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m glad you were able to become leader, Renga. But make sure you find the time to apologize to Liguang.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’ll head out first. I need to go to practice.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Awawah… Th-This is so awkward…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Guess Liguang-san woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I’m sure you’ll do a good job, Leader.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!

Huh, w-why…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I mean, you’re staying on top of all your celebrity stuff. If you can make it in an industry like that, you can make it anywhere.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…You’re not against it…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
We had drinks together, so we’re friends, right? Friends cheer each other on.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wow… Is Renga-kun getting emotional…?)</p>

<p class="t">(It’d be better if he didn’t get into fights with Liguang-san, but I’m happy that he was able to become friends with Ten-kun…)</p>

<p class="t">(Hmm, I’m a little worried, but…if Renga-kun really wants to be the leader, then I’ll do my best to support him!)</p>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
How far along are you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Just gotta push a little bit more. He’s the most gullible guy I’ve ever met. Why’d you even make me do this?

He’d prolly even tell _you_ eventually.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I made the wrong first move.

And I’d rather not get involved in that manner. Just talking to him is unpleasant enough.

Nishizono Renga… He must be connected to _him._ Figure it out.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
You mean Kiba, right?

Who is he to you? Are you two destined lovers or something?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I don’t recall interrogating me being part of your job.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ahaha, I was just kidding. I don’t really care.

Alright, I’ll try and bring you some good news next time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Destiny… In a way, he’s right.

<p class="t">(No, it’s something much deeper. You might even call it fate… Kiba&NoBreak;—)</p>

I _will_ find you…
