<Bubble character="Kafka">
Phew… Well, that’s that. I believe you. I don’t think you’d have any reason to lie to us.

But I want to tell you that the person I acknowledge as the Ward 3 mayor is _you,_ Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
When I give orders, I don’t tell them to the real “Renga.” I tell them to you, the Renga standing in front of me.

So I want you to promise me something no matter what happens.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wh-What is it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Don’t just vanish if the real “Renga” comes back. Talk to us first. Get in touch and ask for advice.

If you don’t, I might just dismiss you. Got it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-Is that a threat?!

…Okay. I won’t just disappear. You guys have helped me out so much.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Good.

You’re the Renga that we all know and support, so you should be relying on us.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Kafka…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, and all of this is an order from your president.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Exactly. Your situation is complicated, but we’ll always stay the same. The other Renga won’t be returning immediately, so nothing has to change.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yukikaze… Th-Thank you.

And, uh… Ten.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Yeah?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m sorry. I know we became friends, but I’m not really Nishizono Renga, so…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
<p class="t">(He’s worried about _that?_ God, who cares?)</p>

<p class="t">(This guy’s a real piece of work.)</p>

I mean, it’s fine. _You’re_ the person I’m friends with, Renga-san.

Maybe if I ever met the real “Renga,” I’d be friends with him too. That’d be a nice bonus.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!

Y-Yeah! I think you’d be good friends with him!

Um… Even when I have to go back to the streets, I’ll never forget how kindly you treated me. Th-Thank you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ahaha…

<p class="t">(Ugh, gimme a break…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m sorry that I brought up something so dark. But I’m gonna keep working hard on our first tour as the Ward 3 mayor and Morning Team leader!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Y-Yeah… This whole thing was really surprising, but it’s not like Renga-kun’s gonna disappear. We need to keep moving forward.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, then everything’s settled.

It’s pretty late, so let’s all head to bed. Renga, I won’t let you slack off just because you won the game show. Keep working hard!

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh&ast;

<p class="t">(That idiot. I didn’t expect him to expose everything himself.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Good eveniiiing. Your favorite spy’s here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh&ast; What is it now? Get lost.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
C’mon, don’t be like that. I just wanted to talk.

Renga-san’s like a totally different person now. Well, I guess he literally _is_ a completely different person.

So I assume that Kiba is the original Nishizono Renga?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Tch…

Hired grunts like you have no business meddling around. Do you have a death wish?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Damn, so mean. It’s just some info to keep the family going.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/assets/illust/010_01.jpg" alt="010_01" type="cg" />

<Bubble character="Ten">
But y’know…

You have to give it to him. Sure, he’s an idiot, but he did all of that work for someone else, not for himself.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I didn’t wanna believe him when he said that he’d give everything back to the real Renga, but his eyes looked serious about it.

Guys like us can always tell when people are lying, and I’ll be the first one to tell you that he wasn’t. Sucks for us.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
What do you mean by that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Well, y’know… Maybe there isn’t really a point in targeting him if this is how things are gonna go.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Have you grown attached? I didn’t expect that from you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Huh? Haha, I was just kidding.

We both thought that we had him in our trap, but it backfired on us. And the only reason why it did was because the guy was just too genuine, I guess.

That kinda stuff doesn’t really happen in this line of work. It’s like a little miracle.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Hmph. We’ve already sent all of your payments to Ninokuruwa. I have nothing to do with you anymore. Stop getting involved.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Yeah, guess so. Well, I’m always here for my customers if they need me. Lemme know if you need my assistance.

Good night, Mr. Normal Ward 4 Mayor. Mr. Normal Ward 1 Mayor is gonna head on out.

&ast;phone ringing&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Sojun" hidden>
&lt;&NoBreak;Boss, the media is ready to make a move regarding Nishizono Renga whenever you’d like.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun" hidden>
&lt;&NoBreak;Boss…?&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Shit.

There’s no need for that, Sojun. Dismiss them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun" hidden>
&lt;&NoBreak;Are you sure?&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Making a move right now isn’t a good idea. Kiba… No…

Renga has us beat.

Dispose of all of the info. Got that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun" hidden>
&lt;&NoBreak;…Understood.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;beep&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
“When the real Renga comes back, I want you two to get along…”

Renga, you’re an imbecile. Kiba has you completely fooled.

<p class="t">(I’ll never get along with the likes of him… But someone else had that same wish a long time ago.)</p>

&ast;sigh…&ast;

<p class="t">(So long ago that I can’t even remember…someone whose very existence was in danger wished for the same thing.)</p>

He wished for this fate to come to an end…
