<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’d like to congratulate everyone in the Morning Team on a job well done. I’ve received all your ward tour plans. This is great for us.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I’m sure it was a lot of work to finish them in such a short amount of time. Good job, everyone!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I knew I could put my trust in your shining talent…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I also have something I’d like to announce. I’ve had an app developed for us and our guests to use. I’ll send it to all of your devices, so have a look.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
This one? Woah, it’s so easy to tell where the crowded areas are and how to arrange car rides…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
If we use this during our tours, we can avoid having too many guests crowd into a single ward, which will result in a more pleasant experience for everyone.

With that said, I’d like for us to start finding participants for our first tour. As for how we can advertise it…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, uh, can I…say something?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Hm? What is it, Renga?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…I’ve been focusing on mayor stuff lately, so I haven’t made many appearances as a celebrity, but…I want to advertise our tour, so I asked my manager if they could get me on TV more.

Then I got an offer from a show that always pulls in crazy high ratings…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
That’s amazing. What’s it called?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
_Celebrity Ranking Royale…_
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ah! It’s that really popular game show that airs in mahorova!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
They give you a ton of time to promote anything you want if you win, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
If I remember correctly… They give you some items, and you need to figure out which ones are the expensive real ones and which ones are the cheap fakes… It can be anything from meat to wine, even dances and movies.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah. You win if you can guess the real ones right more than your opponents… I’ve…been thinking of going.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Are you insane?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wh-What’s the problem? What’s wrong with me going?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
There’s no way you would win.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
W-Well, my manager did tell me that I shouldn’t go, because if I talk for too long, they’ll find out that I’m stupid…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Ah, I see… I guess his manager is a harsh critic too.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
But I can’t let that stop me. This is our big chance…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Hmm, but didn’t you say that your whole celeb thing is a lie? It’d be pretty bad if they found out.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Well, yeah, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Tadaaaaa! That was the sound of me appearing on the scene. In times like these, rely on none other than Karigane Sakujiro. I will be your support, Nishizono-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ah, I see. Sakujiro was talking about wanting to do something on the side yesterday. I guess he was talking about you, Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
“On the side”?!

Ah, well, yeah. Sakujiro-san went through all of the past episodes of the show, and got almost everything right.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
It was difficult to assess the wine and meat through the screen, but I can assure you that I would answer correctly if I could taste them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well, I’d expect Sakujiro to get all of the answers right. He could also make sample questions based off of the show’s history.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Yes, without a doubt. Wine, meat, the arts… By taking into consideration the time of airing and the time of preparation, I can very accurately determine what they will ask.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(If this were anyone else, I’d be surprised. But coming from Sakujiro-san, it’s not too shocking…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Also… I was thinking about this while I read all of your tour plans today, but…my ideas just aren’t as good as everyone else’s.

So I wanna help advertise our tour at least! Sakujiro-san said that he would train me… I wanna work towards that win!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Renga-kun…! He’s grown so much that he’s almost unrecognizable from when I first met him. He can finally own up to his weaknesses…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It’s worth a try. We’ve got nothing to lose. Sakujiro’s going to put you through the wringer, but you’re prepared for that, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…! Yeah! I’ll win this and spread the word about our tour for sure!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
I will be sure to match your level of enthusiasm, Nishizono-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Sakujiro-san’s training will probably be really, _really_ hard, but…Renga-kun might win this if he goes through with it.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
We’ll all be supporting you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
…Yeah, sure, I guess.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">

<Bubble character="Sojun">
…That’s how we’ve been moving as of late.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/33-2.jpg" alt="2" />

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Understood. Good work on mediating while I’ve been gone, Sojun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
It is my duty to do so.

Additionally…we’ve discovered the whereabouts of the former Mrs. Nishizono after she fled HAMA following her divorce. We’ve also conducted a DNA test.

True to your suspicions, Nishizono Renga…is not blood related to either of his parents.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I see.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
We’re keeping an eye on the alleyway that Murakumo Ten discovered. There have been no developments there yet, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Kiba is incredibly perceptive. He might have already realized that we’re onto him.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;thunder rumbles&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
When do you plan to reveal Nishizono Renga’s true identity?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

That idiot is going to appear on a popular TV show soon. The best time to strike…would be right after that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
I will let the media know.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
That sounds good.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;thunder rumbles&ast;

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I’m going back to the dorms. I’ll let you handle the rest.

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast; I’m all wet from the rain.

<p class="t">(Hm? The lights in the living room are on… It’s 1 a.m.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Incorrect. That is the 1000 yen wine. The genuine Romaine Comte is number three.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Urgh… I diddun knyow… O-One more…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
You seem quite drunk, so let us stop for tonight. We have been practicing for five hours.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
N-Nah, ‘m ‘kay… I almoss got it… U-Ugh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
I shall bring you some water.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga" hidden>
_One more…! Pleashe…_
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

How pointless…

<p class="t">(Even if he wins, everything will come crashing down on him soon… I won’t be holding back.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Mmmm… Th’ 1000 yen wine is, like…kinda refreshin’... ‘N’ th’ Romaine Comte is…stronger…I think… Gotta write it down…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

<p class="t">(Show yourself already, Kiba… You can still keep your protégé out of harm’s way.)</p>

……

<p class="t">(How absurd. Trivial emotions like these only lead to tragedy… I won’t let it happen again.)</p>

<p class="t">(I won’t show sympathy…not to someone so close to Kiba.)</p>
