<p class="t">(The Landmark Tower used to be at the mercy of a certain celebrity’s less than ideal plans, but…)</p>

<p class="t">(Now it’s back to the observation deck we all know and love!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Hm, what is that…? “Even the celebs love this crepe…?”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It has rose ice cream in it at the mayor’s request. Would you like to try one?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Rose…ice cream?!

<p class="t">(I-It’s calling to all of my senses… No, this is just for research. Since it’s made to include HAMA’s town flower, I must eat it for research!)</p>

&ast;cough&ast; Yes, that would be wonderful.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Alright! Could we have one rose ice cream crepe, please?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Food Stand Employee">
Of course, here you go. Hope you enjoy!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
&ast;munch&ast;

<p class="t">(It’s delicious…! The fragrant rose flavoring and the refreshing ice cream are joining together in perfect harmony…!)</p>

<p class="t">(I thought the Ward 3 mayor was an utter idiot. Is he really behind something this superb…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist E">
I-It’s Nishizono Renga! I totally became his fan after seeing him get drunk on that game show.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist F">
I remember that! It was such a cute and unexpected side of him!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist B">
I like the whole egotistical thing he does, but I really liked seeing him drunk like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist A">
I wanna see him act like that even more! Let’s go talk to him!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wow… He’s totally surrounded. Yachiyo-kun’s with him too… I-Is he gonna be okay?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist K">
I saw you on _Celebrity Ranking Royale_ the other day! You were so cute!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist L">
Can I shake your hand?! And can I have an autograph too?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Ahh… They’re really putting on the pressure… I hope Renga-kun doesn’t snap like he did at the airport that one time…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Y-You watched the show I was on? Thank you. Are you having fun here?

I can shake your hand. Hold on, let me get some wet wipes to clean my hands…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist M">
Oh, my god, he’s a completely different person in real life!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist N">
Renga! I want one too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wahwahwah… W-What do we do? It’s like we’re in a vortex… I feel like I’m gonna get swept up into the storm and die…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
S-Sorry! Can we form a line? I’ll get to everyone!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Foreign Tourist">
Hi, gorgeous! Can I ask you something? Blahblahbleeblooblah!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
A-A foreigner?! Translator, translator… Oh, no, I opened my curses and hexes app!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Foreign Tourist">
Are there any interesting sights around here? Bloobleebloh!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Renga-kun’s not good at English… I need to help him!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Z-Zattsu fain! Um, m-mai rekomendo izu… Yadda yadda yadda…

Wah-wah wahwah! Yadda yadda…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Foreign Tourist">
Oh! Yoku wakarimashita! Arigatou!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
HA-HAMA NICE TRIP!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You did it, Renga-kun! That was amazing!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah… Chief. You were watching?

I’ve been using videos to study English every day. I do practice drills too. I’m glad it all came in handy…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(My heart feels so full… But I don’t have any time to waste.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist M">
Renga! Can we talk to you too?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Chief, would you lend me a hand?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Of course!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(Hm. I should take this as an opportunity to assess the Ward 3 mayor.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider omotenashi />

<Bubble character="Renga">
Come to our concert after this too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist L">
Yeah! I’m super excited for it! Thanks for the autograph and the handshake!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(He seems to have grown quite a bit in this short amount of time. I didn’t expect him to handle his guests so well. He was about to bring Ward 3 to ruin before…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Everyone was able to leave with a smile. Th-Thanks for helping me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Thank you too! It’s almost time for your hospitality live show, isn’t it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wow… My dreams are about to come true…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah. Chief, Yachiyo…let’s make this a good one!
</Bubble>
