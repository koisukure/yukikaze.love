<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Mm, the shrimp ones are good. How are you doing with the mushrooms and edamame ones?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
They taste amazing! I can’t choose which of the Ward 2 speciality shumai I like best…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thanks for the help, Chief. Seeing your smile warms my heart. It’s like a bamboo steamer full of shumai…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Uhhh… I guess that’s a compliment?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okaaay, there’s absolutely no need to be that close. Step back, please and thank you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka, could you do a taste test for us too? We also have shumai filled with spinach, squid, and octopus… Do you have ideas for other fillings we could use?
</Bubble>

<Diff g="m">
<Bubble character="Kafka">
You know you’re bothering our chief by making him help you all the time, right?
</Bubble>
</Diff>
<Diff g="f">
<Bubble character="Kafka">
You know you’re bothering our chief by making her help you all the time, right?
</Bubble>
</Diff>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka, that’s not true. I’m helping because I want to.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, really? Then I guess I should help too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh? But you don’t know how to cook.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It can’t be that hard. You just take the wrapper…

…Urk.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(It’s a complete mess… Kafka’s really not cut out for this…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It’s okay, Kafka. You just got out of the hospital, so don’t beat yourself up about the smashed shumai.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I don’t really see the correlation there…but whatever. If I say that, I might stir things up…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I only messed up once! I’ll do better next time… Agh.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
The squashing is almost artistic.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You’re trying to insult me, aren’t you? Damn, one more try…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka… To think you would work so hard for my sake… My heart is filled with brotherly love…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I am absolutely _not_ doing this for your sake. How are you so positive all the time…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…It’s been a while since we all got together like this. This is so fun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…As long as you’re having fun, I’m glad.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah. Chief’s smile is just like a bamboo steamer full of shumai, don’t you think, Kafka?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
What is wrong with you?
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Mm, looks like we’re all done. The Ward 2 shumai are good for now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ugh, I’m so annoyed. Whatever. Having a specialty dish for the ward is a good thing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Chief, do you want to name them? I’d like you to do the honors.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh, are you sure?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I think you’re the best one for the job, Chief. This guy over here called your smile a bamboo steamer full of shumai. Can you really trust him to name things?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, ahaha… I’ll give it a try, then…
{/* </Bubble>

[NAME THE WARD 2 SHUMAI]

<Bubble mc> */}
How about… Yukikaze-Style Shumai…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Amazing… It’s as perfect as shumai wrapping and meat coming together.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yukikaze’s opinion aside, I think it’s great!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
We should let everyone else in the dorm try them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
But Renga and Ten are out today.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Right, they messaged us about that this morning. They’re having dinner together.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah, I know they go out to eat together sometimes. It’s great that they’re such good friends.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Hmm, I don’t know if I would call them friends.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Hm?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
<p class="small">…But I guess it’s fine as long as Renga doesn’t get hurt.</p>

<p class="small">Things happen sometimes, but it doesn’t matter as long as it all ends well. I’ll wait and see how things go.</p>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Renga-san, what’re you so nervous for?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I’m not nervous…! It’s not like I’ve never been invited to a friend’s house or anything…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten’s Father (Owner)">
Welcome! Oh, you’re Ten’s friend, right? Order whatever you want, it’s all on the house.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten’s Mother (Owner)">
We’ve heard so much about you. We have plenty of fresh fish, so eat as much as you’d like.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, i-it’s so nice to meet you…! T-Ten-kun’s been a very wonderful friend to me!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Chill out, chill out. Dad, give us whatever you recommend. Oh, and Mom, could you bring out some of our fancy sake?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten’s Mother (Owner)">
Ten, you’re just using Renga-san’s visit as an excuse to drink, aren’t you? I can’t believe you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Heheh, c’mon, a little drinking here and there doesn’t hurt anyone. Right, Renga-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, if there’s anything I can do to help…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten’s Father (Owner)">
Ahaha! Your friend here was raised right, Ten. But you’re our guest today, so don’t worry about it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten’s Mother (Owner)">
That’s right, it’s so rare to see Ten bringing his friends over. Here’s some of our best cold sake. Have a drink!
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble character="Renga">
The sushi and sake here’s so good… Your place is amazing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Right? I totally wanted to show you, since you’re my friend and all.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m your friend…

There’s only one other person in my life who’s called me that…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Just telling the truth.&nbsp;♪ C’mon, have another drink. I want some more too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
‘Kay… &ast;gulp, gulp…&ast; Pwah, damn, that’s good!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">

…Renga-san?

&ast;sigh&ast; Again? Whatever. I got what I needed.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten’s Father (Owner)">
You kept walking around calling the guy gullible, but it took you quite a bit of time. Are you losing your touch, Ten?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten’s Mother (Owner)">
You’re too soft. Getting someone drunk takes at least 30 minutes. It could’ve been done faster if you drugged him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Hey, I wanted to take a load off and drink a little too. All of this work’s got me exhausted.

…He looks like an angel when he sleeps. Your hair’s really silky, Renga-san.

…This shit sucks.

I just need one strand of hair, okay?

Ugh… My head hurts… This hangover’s killing me…

<p class="t">(He invited me over to meet his parents, but I had to go and pass out drunk… Aghh, I’m so stupid!)</p>

<p class="t">(But…when I woke up, Ten let me borrow one of their futons and said that he wanted to take care of me as a friend… Heheh… He’s such a nice guy…)</p>

Um… Nobody’s around here, right?

Gotta attach the coordinates…

Ah, well if it isn’t my honored client. I got the info you were looking for.

<Bubble character="Ten">
C’mon, I don’t make rookie mistakes. I also sent off the strand of hair you asked for.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang" hidden>
&lt;&NoBreak;Got it. I’ll handle it from here. I’ll send you the payment for the work you’ve done so far.&NoBreak;&gt;
