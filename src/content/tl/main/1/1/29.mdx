<Bubble character="Kafka">
<p class="t">(A dream… Was everything…? No, where did it end?)</p>

<p class="t">(No, they already did the operation. I’m still alive.)</p>

&ast;sigh…&ast;

<p class="t">(I’m…back here again.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&ast;gasp&ast; Y-You’re awake…?! Are you okay…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, don’t get up! The doctor said you shouldn’t move…

Um, the chief is talking to your family right now, and Sakujiro’s taking care of all of the paperwork. Everyone else is, uh, they were just here, but they’ll be back soon…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…I see.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Are you feeling alright?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m fine. Sorry for worrying you… I’m a terrible mayor.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…No, you’re not.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ahaha, when I woke up in here, I thought that everything that happened up until now was a long dream.

I thought my surgery failed, and I went back to lying in this bed, useless and struggling to even stay alive.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I can’t believe I fainted after just dancing for a little bit. It’s pathetic. Did I disappoint you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Stop talking about yourself like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…I’m telling the truth.

Oh, but don’t worry. I expected this would happen, so I prepared an AI that would do my work for me while I’m gone.

Sakujiro knows how to activate it, and I’m sure you can do the concert without me if you have to. I was just overdoing things because I knew you have a copy of me to rely o&NoBreak;—
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Shut the hell up!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
An AI can’t replace you!

You’re the one who said that hospitality has value because it’s something that machines can’t do…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m stupid, so I don’t get a lot of things, but…I know that it’s not right to push yourself this hard just because there’s an AI who can do the work for you.

You might be the Ward 0 mayor and a member of the Morning Team… But I’m the leader…!

Rely on me, for god’s sake! There’s so much you can do that I can’t!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Renga…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Don’t call yourself useless. You’re amazing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

I never thought I’d be lectured by you, Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m only doing it because you don’t take care of your health…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Haha. I’m sorry.

I’ll take it back. Well, I was telling the truth about the AI, but…

That was the first time in my life I felt that I could devote myself to something and work at it for my future.

Maybe dancing isn't for me, but it felt like a school club, so…I was having fun. I’ve never experienced school life first hand.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I see…

But still… You shouldn’t push yourself so hard!

<p class="t">(Between my skating and my work as mayor… Even my life itself… Is this really what I want…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah. You’re right… I’m just worried.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…But you’re so smart.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ahaha, what does that have to do with anything?

…I’m a lot like my mother. Frustratingly so.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, I think I know about her. She was a famous scientist…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah. She was also beautiful and perfect at everything. Just like me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Y-Yeah.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
She died when I was still young… She had a weak constitution.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
She achieved a lot while she was alive, but she never finished the last research project she was working on.

When her time was almost up, I still remember seeing her crying, saying that she didn’t want to die, all the while trying to hide those feelings from me.

She acted brave in front of me, but she was afraid of dying without accomplishing anything…or so my dad told me.

I saw it sometimes when I was little.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
That…must’ve been hard.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah. That’s why I’m worried. I don’t want to die without achieving my goal like my mom did.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…But whatever. I’m just whining now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…I know how hard it is to lose a family member. Something like that can…change your whole life.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
But you’re not your mother, and I… I’m not my grandmother.

You can’t be someone you’re not. It doesn’t matter how similar you are, you’ll never turn into them.

…I won’t tell you to stop worrying. But let yourself be pampered sometimes! Give us orders as president, or something!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You made us live in those dorms even though we didn’t want to and dragged us out on a study trip… You’re pushy as hell!

So why are you trying to hold yourself back in the worst ways? Aren’t presidents supposed to be selfish?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Huhh? Ahaha… What are you talking about?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You’re scared of failing. I’m…really scared too. If I fail now…Ward 3 is done for. So I’m worried too.

You’re out here overseeing all of HAMA, and you even put in all of your assets and bet your whole life on this…so I know that you feel like you have to succeed.

But you’re the one who said that teamwork is important! So… I’ll come visit you here every day and dance for you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Huh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You’ll memorize the choreo if you see it that often, right? I’m good at physical stuff like this, so leave it all to me!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

Haha…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
?!

W-Why are you laughing?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
No, it’s just… You’re gonna come in here to dance? Every day?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah, that’s what I just said!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Aha, ahaha…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huhhh?! What’s so funny?! Are you feeling loopy from a fever or something…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Sorry, haha, you really got me… I can’t breathe, hahaha…

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I heard someone laughing from outside. Kafka, you’re awake. That’s a relief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, Yukikaze! Hey, can you watch me dance for a moment and lemme know if I got the choreo down?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…? Sure, but why here?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I told Kafka that I’d come visit every day and dance for him. He can memorize it that way, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Ah, I see. That’s a good idea. But we have that video of Yachiyo showing us the choreography, right? Couldn’t he just watch that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wh… Ah… W-We do…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ahahahaha!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Kafka! You knew the whole time, didn’t you?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ahh, my stomach hurts…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I was trying to be nice… Dammit, you can just watch the video, then…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Nah. Renga, I want you to come visit and dance for me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
And that’s an order from your president.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!

Dammit… Fine. I’ll do it! You better be grateful!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah… This is the first time I’ve been glad to have you as our leader. Thanks, Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wait, so that means you didn’t approve of me before?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ahaha, hey, don’t get mad at me. I’m just a sickly patient, remember?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
<p class="t">(I don’t know what happened, but they seem closer than before.)</p>

My little brothers are working so hard.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m not your little brother. And I need _you_ to work hard too, you know.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Of course. I’ll keep that in mind.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Ah, am I interrupting?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
No, we just got started. Kafka’s awake.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka… Um… Are you okay?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Yeah.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Things are still awkward since we had that fight. I should apologize, but I still don’t want him to push himself…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Did you two have a fight or something?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well, not really, I guess…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
What the hell?! Chief was worried like crazy about you. It was like the world was about to end.

Let’s get outta here, Yukikaze!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh? Renga-kun?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m leaving you two here on your own! So talk things out! Um… That’s an order from your leader.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
He’s right. You need to make up.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka… I called you a dumbass the other day…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Is it true?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Renga said you were so worried about me that it felt like the world was about to end… Is that true?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
W-Well yeah, of course! I’m always worried about you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…I can’t keep this up. I wanted to stay composed in front of you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
But it’s fine. I’m happy… Chief… Um… I was being stubborn too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…! So it’s all behind us, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Yeah!

Ah, I expect you to come visit me every day. Even Renga’s going to do that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Come on, are you trying to make me run errands for you again?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Is that a bad thing? I think I’ll get better quicker if I get to see your face.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Oh, fine! But just this once!

<p class="t">(I’m glad that Kafka’s case wasn’t anything too serious. But he has to stay in the hospital for a few days just in case…)</p>

Phew. That quad didn’t feel right. I need to figure out how to make my jumps more stable…

<p class="t">(Is this the only goal I can ever pursue…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Yukikaze.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Is something wrong, Dad? If it’s about my quads, I&NoBreak;—

Ah, we can talk about it later. But for now, take a look at this.

This is…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
You have to submit your proposal for the Ward 2 tour, right? You can use this; I came up with it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
You still have many competitions ahead of you. I can handle all of your mayoral work, so you should focus on skating.
</Bubble>

&ast;paper flipping&ast;

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
This…is almost the exact same plan as the one we used three years ago.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Is that a problem? This plan pulled in the most guests in recent years. It works fine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
But…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
You still haven’t cleaned up your quads, so you don’t have any time to devote to other matters.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Don’t worry about it. The plan shouldn’t fail.

As long as you do what I say, it’ll work out. That’s how it’s worked for years, Yukikaze.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
<p class="t">(…Renga will probably be visiting Kafka in the hospital to dance for him today.)</p>

<p class="t">(And Kafka works hard to the point of collapse. But I…)</p>
