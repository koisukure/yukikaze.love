<p class="t">(A thunderstorm… They always come when I get involved with _him._)</p>

It’s as if he’s sitting next to me, even now…

…What is it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun" name="???">
Status update, Boss.

We’ve investigated the recent behavior of the wolves, as requested. As you have predicted, it seems that they are using underhanded methods to invade Lurong territory.

They don’t seem to be after the Lurong family’s long-time associates, but rather the ones who have newly moved in. We believe this to be a deliberate move.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I see. Sojun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
Yes, Boss?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Do you think that their actions can be considered extreme? Or… do you see them more as petty, childish pranks?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
…I do see them as quite childish, however…they seem to have connections to Homare, a tertiary organization that opposes the Lurong family.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…If they’re willing to go that far, there’s no doubt that they have more power than we previously thought. I’d expect that from him.

…Tch. We’re running out of time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
Should we deal with them…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing" name="???">
Liguang, I’m hoooome!!

Wha&NoBreak;— Why’s it so dark in here?! Turn on the lights, geez!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Linxing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Ugh, if you’re talking to Sojun then just keep the lights on! You start drifting off into a different dimension as soon as you sit down to think about things!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
My apologies.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Oh, my god, Liguang, you’re gonna go to that dorm place tomorrow, right? I already taught Sojun!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Taught him what?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
How to braid, duh! I’m always the one who does it for you, so I taught Sojun how to do it now that you’re gonna be living in the dorms!

You’re gonna be seeing each other at the offices, like, every day, right? So let him braid your hair! Don’t let your pretty hair go to waste.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
Rest assured, Linxing-sama. I remember the basics you taught me. I will do the duty of braiding Liguang-sama’s hair.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Awesome, thanks! And Liguang, you should learn how to braid from Sojun while you’re at it.

Sojun needs his days off, so you should be able to do it when he’s not around!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast; Fine. You better not cause any trouble for our family while I’m gone.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
I won’t, sheesh! Oh, also, Mom told me that you’re gonna be roomies with Kamina Yukikaze!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Acting like you didn’t hear me won’t work! Big sis knows too, so I’m not letting you weasel your way outta this.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast; What do you want?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
You read my mind! I knew I could count on you, Liguang! Can you get his autograph for me?

I need four, so it’s one for me, one for our sister, one for Mom, and one for my boyfriend!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Did nobody teach you that bothering strangers is rude?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
But Yukikaze isn’t even a stranger to you, he’s your roomie! That basically means you’re friends, right?

Oh, my god, can you tell him I’m his biggest fan? And that I loooove his step sequences! Especially when he did "La campanella" for his program last year…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Fine, I’ll get his autograph. But I’m only getting three.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Whaaaat, lame!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Linxing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Hm? What is it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

Nothing, just remember to do what your mother and sister tell you to do… Don’t do anything dangerous.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Aw, what’s that all about? I listen to them all the time.

Besides…if I get into anything dangerous, you’ll protect me, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Yeah, I will.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
I’m gonna go and tell the other two about the autographs!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

Sojun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
Yes, Boss?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Strengthen the watch on Linxing while I’m gone.

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

<p class="t">(A relaxed axel… Next, a butterfly jump…into a sit spin…)</p>

<p class="t">(These moments when I become one with the music and dance across the ice are when I’m happiest.)</p>

<p class="t">(Focus on your spin variations and step sequence instead of landing quads… To truly express myself in my skating, I…)</p>

Achoo.

Phew, I should take a break.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
I think you’ve warmed up enough. Don’t just do doubles. You need to be practicing your quads too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thank you, Dad. I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll get to them after my break.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Your biggest weakness right now is in the timing of your jumps. Your speed, height, and rotations are all up to par, but it feels like something’s holding you back from keeping up the momentum.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yes, you might be right.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
You have the technical ability, without a shadow of a doubt. If you could tap into that during competitions…you’ll start to see your medals change. Do you plan on getting second place forever?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…No, I don’t.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
You’re leaving to live in those dorms starting tomorrow, right? Doing PR work is essential if you want to continue skating, but you don’t need to worry too much about your mayor work.

All you need to do is show up. Since I was the previous Ward 2 mayor, I can handle all of those responsibilities behind the scenes for you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…But I… It’s something I get to do with <Name first />, so I…
</Bubble>

<Diff g="m">
<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Hm? I’m sure he knows how important skating is to you, so there shouldn’t be an issue.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Hm? I’m sure she knows how important skating is to you, so there shouldn’t be an issue.

……

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
The work you do as mayor will be seen favorably by the JPN Skating Federation, since it helps improve the image of their competitions. That’s why I agreed to become mayor myself.

Your purpose in life is to win gold medals. Your mayoral duties will act as a stepping stone towards that goal, so take them seriously.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I understand.

<p class="t">(My only purpose is to win…? Being able to work alongside <Name first /> makes me happier than anything else, but…)</p>

<p class="t">(I need to focus on my skating career too. Still, does that career really mean nothing outside of collecting medals?)</p>
