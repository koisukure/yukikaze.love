<p class="t">(It’s finally our first day! I should be meeting my new coworkers in a bit… I’m a little nervous.)</p>

<p class="t">(I talked to Renga-kun here last week… I hope he’s doing alright. It seemed like he was going through a lot.)</p>

<p class="t">(It sucks, but there’s nothing I can do. Let’s focus on work for now!)</p>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
What’s with the goofy look on your face? Still busy as ever, huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh?! Da-Daniel-san?! Why are you here?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
What? ‘Cuz I work here?

Nice to meetcha! HAMA Tours department head Iwabuchi Daniel Hiroshi, reporting for duty.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…! …! …!

<p class="t">(N-No way… Department head…? He’s working as a manager again…?! A slacker like him?! Kafka, why in the world did you hire this guy…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
I’m expecting a lot outta you now that we’re working together again, Chief.&nbsp;♪ I’m gonna head in first.
</Bubble> 

<Bubble mc>
Th-This means you’re one of our founding members, you know! I’m begging you, please actually do your work this time!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Gahaha, well, we’ll see!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Good morning to you, Chief. And to you as well, Manager.

Chief, I have set up the flowers you had sent. Thank you very much for the kind gesture.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Good morning, Sakujiro-san! I’m glad you like them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
But of course. Young Master Ka&NoBreak;— Ah, I mean, our president also fancies them quite a bit.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(…I guess Sakujiro-san is another one of our founding members. It’s a little weird to be working alongside him, since I’ve known him for ages…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
I will simply be working as an ordinary employee. Thus, if there are any errands you would like done, please direct them to me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It’s okay, you don’t need to do all of that…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Thanks for takin’ on all the boring busy work, Sakujiro.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Daniel-san… Can you be considerate for once…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
What, you think I’m just gonna refuse when he’s offering?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Good morning. Sounds like a party in here. Thanks for the flowers, Chief.&nbsp;♪ Did you think about me when you picked them out?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, Kafka, good mor&NoBreak;—
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Good morning, Mr. President! You look handsome as ever today.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Is Daniel-san trying to get on Kafka’s good side…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Good morning. I have our other two founding members with me, so I’ll introduce them to you all.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki" name="???">
Good morning. I assume you two are the manager and chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wow… He looks so friendly and reliable!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
This is Kitakata Nayuki. I met him in the investment world a long time ago. I brought him in to lead our financial department.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Please let me know if there’s anything you need regarding our finances. I’ll do my best to help.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Woah, he’s really got it together…! Thank God…)</p>

<p class="t">(Hm? I feel like I’ve seen him before…but I don’t know where. Maybe a magazine interview or something?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Nayuki also has experience as the previous COO of JPN’s most popular metaverse service, <span class="green">mahorova</span>. He knows his stuff.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah…! You’re that prodigy entrepreneur who made mahorova when you were only 12…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Oh, that was over 11 years ago. I’m just your average finance manager now, so no need to be so formal.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s achieved so much, but he’s still so nice and humble… Kafka, you brought in the best person for the job…!)</p>

<p class="t">(I wonder why someone as amazing as him decided to come here of all places, but… I guess it’s because he’s friends with Kafka?)</p>

<p class="t">(…I also kind of feel like I’ve heard the name Kitakata somewhere else, but I don’t remember where…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Nayuki will also be working on some other stuff eventually, but he’ll just be on finances for the time being.

I also hired an intern for us, but…

<Bubble character="Yachiyo" name="???">
W-Wahhhhh! I knocked over the flower vase…! HyahhhhI’msorryI’msorryI’msorryyyyyyyy!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Oh, dear. The flowers that Chief had delivered are a mess.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo" name="???">
I-I can pick them up!! Ow!! The glass… I’m bleeding… I’m bleediiiiing!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
&ast;sigh…&ast; Sakujiro, please take care of his cuts and put up the flowers again.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" shake>
I shall have it done in 30 seconds.

Whoosh! Swoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(What… What am I looking at here…?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo" name="???">
Oh, wow… Oh, wow wow wow… I didn’t even see you put the bandage on… A-Are you a god?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yachiyo. Come over here. Those flowers mean a WHOLE LOT to me, okay? Don’t touch them again.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ack… Yes, sir, I-I’m so sorry sir, I won’t come near it ever again, sir…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Fuefuki-kun, if I may. When you open a door, remember to first look to your right, then to your left. Keep yourself at least 1 meter away from any fragile objects.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ye-Yes, sir!!!! I’ll write that down!! I’ll write down every single word!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Hey, attaboy! He’s got this intern thing down pat.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Looks like we have another…“interesting” person on our team…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
This is Fuefuki Yachiyo. His application was a little weird and I found it interesting, so I hired him.&nbsp;♪ Be nice to him, everyone.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He hired him because he found him weird and interesting…? Why is Kafka always like this?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
And oooone moooore thiiiing… Tada! It’s Shumai, our mascot dog!
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/4-5.jpg" alt="5" />

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Woof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh, I didn’t even see you bring Shumai in! Wait, why is he here in the first place?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
He’s so cute. Do you already know him, Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Uh, well… I only know him because we found him hurt in the hospital courtyard when Kafka was still an inpatient…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
We took care of him in the hospital together. I brought him with me when I got discharged, because he just kept following me around.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
So that’s what happened… Aw, Shumai, I really missed you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Huff huff, woof woof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Aww, not fair. Why does Shumai only get uppies? Carry me too, like you always used to.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Wh-What are you talking about…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Haha, I see you two are quite close.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, it’s not like that, we’re just old friends…! Sorry, we shouldn’t be messing around like this…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You’re right, we are very close.&nbsp;♪ Manager Nayuki, I hope you’re not planning on making a move on our chief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I have no idea what Kafka’s going on about…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
“Don’t make a move on our chief…” O-Okay, I got it!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yachiyo-kun, you don’t need to write that down!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Alright… Now that everyone’s here, we can start our first strategy meeting.
</Bubble>
