<Bubble character="Renga">
Ugh, I’m so nervous. Hey, are you sure this disguise is gonna hide my noble aura…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I think you’re good…! Plus, we’re standing as far away as we can to listen in.

<p class="t">(We all knew that Yuki-nii was gonna talk to his dad today, but I didn’t expect Renga-kun to invite me to spy on them… He must really want to cheer Yuki-nii on. That makes me happy!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah… There they are. That guy’s Yukikaze’s father, right? I always saw him at the kiss and cry in the recordings I watched…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah, that’s Uncle Sadayuki. He’s pretty strict, so I’m worried that he might not hear Yuki-nii out…

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Dad, I want to talk before we start.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
What is it? We don’t have a lot of time today, so keep it short.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…It’s about my practice regimen. I want to take some time to work on expressiveness and techniques outside of my jumps.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
That’s unnecessary. What you need to focus on is your quads.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I don’t agree with that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
What’s this all of a sudden? You’ve been doing well under my instruction. If you keep at it, you’ll be able to get gold…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…It’s not “all of a sudden,” Dad. I’ve had these thoughts for a while now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…? What was that? I couldn’t hear you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You want me to land quads and bring home gold medals because it was _your_ dream when you were still competing, but I don’t think I want to live like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…?!

W-What are you…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
How my life ends up doesn’t reflect on your own.

…I’ve been wanting to tell you that for ages.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Wh&NoBreak;— What do you mean by that…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m not a kid anymore. I want to decide the way I skate. And…I also want to take my mayoral work seriously.

I’ll still listen to you when I can, but I’ll have the final say on my practice regimen.

And I’ll take the lead in the work I do as mayor. I’ll come up with the tour plan on my own.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…That’s nonsense! If you do that, you’ll start doing worse in your competitions, and&NoBreak;—
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You don’t know that. There’s a chance I might do better than I have before. So I want you to listen to me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Gh…

I just don’t understand where this came from out of nowhere…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I told you, it’s not from out of nowhere. This has been on my mind for a long time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…I can understand your view on your skating. You’re at the age where skaters start wanting more freedom in what they do.

You just can’t be sure that it’ll work out…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It’s worked out for countless others before me, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…

Th-Then are you sure that you can handle your mayoral work? I’ve been taking care of all of it up until now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Try these.

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…What are these? Are those snowflakes?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Here, chopsticks.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…Fine, but just one.

……

…! <span class="small">It’s so good…</span>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m glad you think so.

I made them while I was thinking about what I could do for the ward. I wanted to give them to guests who come to visit our ice rink…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
I didn’t know you could do this…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Dad, I’m not sure if you knew, but I’m good at cooking.

Sadayuki …Huh?

Do you remember how nobody was around the house unless it had to do with skating? I’d just get an allowance so I could buy my own meals. But…I used that money to buy ingredients to cook with instead.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
My cousins would come over all the time to help me…so that’s how I learned to cook. You didn’t know any of that, did you?

…When I was free, I’d go and watch plays or ballet performances, and that made me start thinking about my own expressiveness. I knew that you didn’t see that as an important skill, so I never told you about it…

But I’m tired of keeping it a secret. I don’t want to hide the way I want to skate anymore. Of course, I’ll still work on my quads and work towards winning medals.

I don’t want to do everything your way anymore. I&NoBreak;—

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
That’s enough.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
This is giving me a headache. If that’s how you feel…then do what you want.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
&ast;sigh…&ast;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
H-Hey, his father’s leaving. Did everything…turn out alright?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Hmm… I’m not sure…

<p class="t">(Ah, Yuki-nii’s looking over here.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
He’s giving us a thumbs up… Is that a good thing? Wait, does that mean he knows we’re here?!

Dammit, he could sense my celebrity aura…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thanks for the support, you two. You really helped me get through it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Sorry for spying on you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It’s fine, it was encouraging.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Um, will Uncle Sadayuki be okay?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
He must be shocked that I rebelled against him. But he’s a mature adult. He’ll understand eventually.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh, okay… B-But I guess that everything’s settled! That’s good!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Ah, I forgot. Do you want any of the shumai? Chief helped me make them yesterday; I’m really proud of them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Seriously?! I’ll take one…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Have as many as you want.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I don’t think that _everything’s_ settled, but…Yuki-nii looks really happy, so that means we made progress.)</p>

<p class="t">(I know Uncle Sadayuki will understand him someday…!)</p>
