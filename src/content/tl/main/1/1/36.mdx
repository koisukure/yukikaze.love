# The Real Thing

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;We’re down to our last two questions. First up: which one of these is the premium wagyu beef?!&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;Hoping to continue his winning streak, Nishizono Renga says it’s number one! But Narikin Zeinosuke, famous CEO with a yearly income of ten billion yen, says it’s number three!&NoBreak;&gt;

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
&lt;&NoBreak;Chii tried them earlier, and, like, both of them were SO delish. Are you sure one of them’s actually a leather shoe?&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;Nobody would’ve guessed that Nishizono Renga would make it this far with all of the answers correct, given the rumors that he might be a “fake” celebrity.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;Nishizono-kun, how confident are you in your answer?&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&lt;&NoBreak;100%, of course. “All that matters to me…is the real thing.”&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;cheering&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;There’s Nishizono-kun’s signature phrase for you, folks! And the answer is…number one!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
&ast;gasp&ast; Kafka, Renga-kun got it right!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
Making him eat those leather shoes served a purpose.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
He’s doing better than I expected. I can tell from looking at him that it was a close call, but the audience doesn’t seem to realize that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
<p class="t">(Hmmm, yeah… It’s written all over his face that he expected to get it wrong…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Pink Mackerel Avatar">
I guess he _is_ a genuine celebrity.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Spotted Garden Eel Avatar">
But Narikin Zeinosuke’s gotten 90% of the answers right. The last question’s worth a lot of points, so if Nishizono Renga gets it wrong, he might end up losing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;And here’s your final question! Which one of these is the premium wine?!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
Oh my… This does not bode well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
Huh? Why not?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
All of the questions thus far have been exactly the same as the ones that I prepared. Nishizono-san answered them correctly by memorizing my samples…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
<p class="t">(Nobody else besides Sakujiro-san could come up with practice questions to that degree of accuracy…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
After analyzing distribution patterns, I expected the program to bring out the Romaine Comte, however…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
Oh… I see what’s going on. I read in the news the other day that the trade routes between JPN and Europe have been disrupted.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
Precisely. I knew about all of the brands and quantities of wine within JPN, but I ought to have checked the lists from our neighboring countries as well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
Huh? What does that mean…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
They don’t necessarily have to use a Romaine Comte for the show, so some people probably thought it would be easier to switch it out for a more readily available wine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
What…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;The wine you will be looking out for today…is an Unikko!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
I only had Nishizono-san try an Unikko a few times. I apologize, I made a grave mistake.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&lt;&NoBreak;Ah… Eh… Huh? U-Unikko…?&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(&ast;gasp&ast; I can tell he’s shaken up, even from here! He’s gotten everything right so far by just recalling Sakujiro-san’s sample questions, so this must be a huge shock…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
We just have to believe in him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;And since it’s our last question, I’ll allow you to take as many sips as you need to make your guess!&NoBreak;&gt;

<Bubble character="Renga">
&lt;&NoBreak;Mmm… I-I got’ do it all… One m’time…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
&lt;&NoBreak;O-M-G!! Renrey’s so crazy cute! He’s, like, a totally different guy when he’s drunk! And he’s kind of a lightweight!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Spotted Garden Eel Avatar">
I thought he was the stuck-up type, but he’s so cute when he’s drunk…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
<p class="t">(Ahh… Renga-kun was like this when he practiced with Sakujiro-san too… Is he gonna be alright?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang" avatar>
&ast;sigh…&ast;

It’s over. He has no chance of answering correctly in that state.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
…You want to bet on that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang" avatar>
Huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
Let’s bet on it, Liguang. I think Renga’s going to win.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang" avatar>
&ast;sigh&ast; Unlike you, I’m not a gambling addict.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&lt;&NoBreak;Hrmmrhmm… I-I got it! Th’ Unicorn is…&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;It’s called the Unikko, not the Unicorn!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&lt;&NoBreak;Num’ two! ‘Cus it’s the, uh… Strongesh one…!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Zeinosuke">
&lt;&NoBreak;Hmph… A foolish answer. The Unikko is number one. The flavor is deep and rich.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Recently Popular Emcee">
&lt;&NoBreak;And the answer iiiiiis…!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…!

<Bubble character="Renga">
&lt;&NoBreak;Hrm…&NoBreak;&gt;

<Bubble character="Pink Mackerel Avatar">
…He’s kinda cute when he’s drunk.

<Bubble character="Spotted Garden Eel Avatar">
Is the whole giant ego thing he does an act?! Is this what he’s really like?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
Ah. It seems like “Nishizono Renga” is trending on Spinet, along with “HE DROPPED HIS ACT.”
{/* Ah. There seems to be a new trending tag on Spinet. “#NishizonoRengaDropsHisAct,” it says. */}

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
&ast;gasp&ast; Chief, we should log out!

I think the applications for our tour are going to start pouring in!
