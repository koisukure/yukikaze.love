<p class="t">(We have practice tomorrow morning… Well, physical work is the only thing I’m good at… I got this!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
&ast;yawn…&ast; I really don’t wanna go to that early dance lesson tomorrow.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well, you have to. We all work full-time, so the only time we can get together for lessons is either early morning or at night. Besides, aren’t you the least busy out of all of us?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Aw, don’t be like that. I gotta job hunt, y’know?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
And when was the last time you actually took that hunt seriously?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Well, I gotta research the places I apply to instead of just throwing random applications everywhere. Nobody wants an employee who isn’t a good fit for the job, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ten! Do your best… I know you can do it! I believe in you, as your f-f-fr…friend!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
……

Yeah, you’re right. If my friend thinks I can do it, guess I can give it a shot.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
What’s up, Prez?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Nothing. Things are going well for you, aren’t they?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
What’s that supposed to mean? I’m gonna go wash my face.

I’m glad I had this practice room built for situations like this.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wow, wow… I can’t believe we get to practice in a room like this… It’s just like real idol training…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You came up with the choreography, right, Yachiyo-kun?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wah, hyesh! I-I’ll walk everyone through it!

<p class="t">(I didn’t know Yachiyo-kun could choreograph…)</p>

<p class="t">(His expression changed?!)</p>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Wow…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Woah, it’s actually pretty good.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…I didn’t know Yachiyo could do this.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
&ast;pant, pant, pant…&ast; Was that okay?! I tried to dance like some of my ults!

I focused on hand gestures and simple footwork so it wouldn’t be too hard…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I think it was great. Let’s all start practicing. Yachiyo, let us know if you have any advice.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wahhhh, Kamina Yukikaze praised me… The Ice Prince praised _me…_ I-I could die happy…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Give us a notice if you plan on dying.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Kafka… You’re really freaking me out.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Um, so, there’s a turn here from your right… Hm? Wait, was it from your left?

The footwork goes from left to right, right to left… Huh? W-W-Which way’s left again?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Yachiyo-san, you can dance but you can’t _teach_ it? What’s up with that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Left is right and right is left and I am you and you are me… D’ahhh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Hm. Yachiyo, show me the routine again. I think I can memorize it if I see it one more time. I can teach everyone from there.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(That’s a professional figure skater for you! Yuki-nii’s so reliable…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ahuu… O God, Great Buddha, Your Holiness, Yukikazeeeee!! M-My saviooooor!
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ah, I got it. There’s a turn here, and the footwork’s like this.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Lower your hips here and then go like this with your upper body… Like that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Mm, the three of you have it down. Ten, you’re pretty light on your feet. You seem to be decently fit too. Do you do some kind of sport?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ahh, I kinda got into dancing from someone I used to know.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I see. Your movements are clean; you’re pretty good at dancing.

Renga, your experience as a celebrity must be why your presentation is so great. And Liguang, you have excellent balance. Is it because you do martial arts?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I suppose.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(Ugh… I thought I was better at dancing than him, but he’s not even breaking a sweat. Damn you, Liguang…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
What are you staring at?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I wasn’t staring!! Y-Y-You’re just self-conscious!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh&ast; How annoying…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Everyone’s amazing… But what about…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
&ast;pant, pant…&ast; Sorry… I’m holding everyone back.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You had surgery recently. You don’t need to strain yourself to learn it all in one day.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Shut up… I know that. I’ll have it down by the show, so don’t worry about me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Kafka… He’s sweating like crazy. He looks pale too… He’s usually not good with exercise. Is he really gonna be okay?)</p>

<p class="t">(But since Kafka decided on his own that he’s gonna do this, I don’t wanna butt in…)</p>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
What’s with the big sigh, Chief? Is something the matter?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah… Nayuki-kun. Well…

You’ve known Kafka for a while, right? Has he been acting strange to you recently?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
……

Yes, I’m a little concerned. He already has a lot on his plate as our president, and now he has to balance dance practice and vocal lessons on top of it… He doesn’t have any free time in his schedule left.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah! I thought so too. I told him he should rest, but he kept practicing until 2 a.m. last night because he wanted to get the choreography down.

He was just in the hospital up until recently… I’m worried sick…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Are you talking about me behind my back?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka…! W-We weren’t saying anything bad. We’re just worried about you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Exactly, President Oguro. I think you should at least get some sleep.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m getting enough sleep, thank you very much. My stamina’s getting better, so you don’t have to worry so much.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
But…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Chief. No buts.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……

W-What if you faint again?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You think I haven’t considered that? Plus, if I don’t work hard now, then when will I?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
But it doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s more important that you put your heart into your performance.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Huh? So you’re saying that my standards should be lower than the others?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
That’s not what I meant…! But staying up that late to practice is&NoBreak;—
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Stop, I don’t like being hovered around like this. I’ll decide what I can do with my body.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……

Fine! Do what you want, dumbass! I'm gonna get some fresh air!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
&ast;sigh…&ast;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
What is it, Nayuki? Did you finish the documents I told you about yesterday?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
…I put them in the pending box. But just so you know, you shouldn’t fly off the handle like that, no matter how much of a front you want to put on.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
You could just take things slow while you recover from your operation… If you overdo things, it could backfire on you.

I won’t get involved anymore, but I know how strongly you believe that your body is your greatest asset.

Well, I have a meeting with a client, so I’ll be going.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
&ast;sigh&ast;

Damn. You think I don’t know that?

<p class="t">(What else can I do? Nobody could possibly understand what it feels like…)</p>

<p class="t">(To be on the verge of death and wondering if you’ll be able to see tomorrow.)</p>

<p class="t">(...But maybe I took things too far.)</p>

Can I try one more time?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Kafka.

You look exhausted. I think you should stop for today….
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
He’s right. Your heart rate’s too high; it’s not healthy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…I’m fine, okay? Yachiyo, play the song.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
B-Bwut…

Oguro, give it a rest.

Ugh…

I can…play the song…myself…

What are you talking about?! …You’re burning up. Renga, call an ambulance.

Goddammit… Not again…
