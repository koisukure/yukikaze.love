<Bubble character="Hassaku">
What was this called again? A “hospitality live?” I don’t know if this would appeal to an old man like me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
The ward mayors we met today all worked really hard to put this together, so I hope you enjoy it, Matsushige-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(I don’t expect much from a live performance put on by amateurs… But since many of HAMA’s guests are young women, I suppose I see the merit.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist A">
I don’t really expect a whole lot, but all of the mayors in this city are SO cute!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist B">
Yeah, I’m really excited to see them perform!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Hyah… &ast;pant, pant…&ast; Chief, you’re here…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yachiyo-kun? I thought you were working backstage.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Idols are best viewed from the audience!! Wahhhhh, I’m so nervous…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
They are not idols, Fuefuki-kun. I will be joining you. Shff.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Sakujiro-san… When did he get that Kafka uchiwa?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Oh, everyone’s here. No one would notice if I just dipped, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Stay here and watch, please. It’s part of our job.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(All of the HAMA Tours employees are here to watch. This will be our last act of hospitality for the day, no matter how it turns out.)</p>

<p class="t">(You can do it, R1ze!)</p>

They’re here! They look so good together!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist D">
Today was super fun!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Thank you for coming to HAMA. Um… How did everyone like the tour?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist E">
It was awesome!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m really glad you enjoyed it. I worked with all of my partners in R1ze to make it happen.

Do you guys wanna say something too?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Hope you liked the fish.

Here’s a good luck pose from all of us. Ready, and…yayyy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I hope everyone enjoyed my ice show. I’m planning on putting together a new program for the next tour. Please look forward to it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Thank you all for coming here today.

For any guests who were looking to get a second piece of flower word art, I apologize for the trouble. We’ll work to improve the experience.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
We’re going to be holding many more tours from now on, so make sure to stay updated by following us on social media.

I’m going to hand it back to our leader, Renga.

<Bubble character="Renga">
All of us are members of R1ze. We’d be happy if you kept us in your memories.

…I work as a celebrity, but…I do almost all of it for HAMA.

I’ve never talked about this before, but…

I didn’t have a lot I could call my own when I was a kid. But HAMA still forgave me.

I met people in this city who treated me with kindness… There are so many people I want to express my gratitude to.

So I’m here today to do just that. I’m grateful to all of you. Thank you all so much for choosing HAMA!

<p class="t">(Renga-kun came up with one last show to end it off…! Please go well!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist A">
Woah… What’s with these blue lights…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist B">
They’re making everything blue… It’s like we’re in the ocean…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
The sunrise… I see, it’s a representation of mornings in HAMA.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist C">
It’s so pretty…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist D">
It’s like the sun is rising up out of the ocean…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(This is what I wanted to show everyone.)</p>

<p class="t">(For my whole life, I’ve prayed that the sun will rise on me someday, no matter how insignificant I may feel.)</p>

<p class="t">(Even if I have to give my life back to the real “Renga” one day…)</p>

<p class="t">(The life that I’ve lived isn’t fake. Everything I’ve experienced won’t disappear… Just like Grandmother wanted me to…)</p>

<p class="t">(I’m going to live my life to the fullest and burn brightly, like the golden sun.)</p>

This sunrise is our treasure as HAMA residents, but…now it belongs to you too!

HAMA will always be your second home. So come back whenever you’d like!

I’ll be waiting for you… I’ll always be waiting!

And that means all of you! You all matter to me!

Uoahhuaheoayuhhhhh… Th-Th-That wuzz shoooo gooood! It was amazing…! We had to staaaaaan!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You worked really hard on this, Yachiyo-kun. Everyone put their energy into practice to make it succeed.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist D">
I’ve never heard of seeing a concert after a tour, but it was even better than I expected! I wanna see it again!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist E">
The choreo kinda reminded me of that one really popular internet idol… Is that just me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist F">
The song was really good too! I wonder who made it? I’m gonna look it up when I get home.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist A">
Hey, what ward should we choose for the honorary citizen thing? 3 for Renga, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist B">
But I met the mayors from Ward 0 and Ward 4 first today, and I really liked them…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist C">
It’s a hard choice, but I choose Ward 1! I can’t stop thinking about Ten-kun’s knife show!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist D">
Yukikaze’s performance was so good! I chose Ward 2!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist A">
Ahhh, but I want all of the badges! I wanna be a citizen of HAMA with them!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist B">
Let’s sign up for more tours and collect them!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist C">
Yeah, I really wanna come back!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wow, they really seemed to enjoy the tour… Everyone’s gonna be going home happy. That makes me glad.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Chief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, Kafka! Good job up there.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Thanks. Take a look at this. It’s the JPN designated tourism region rankings. It’s updating in real time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
&ast;gasp&ast; W-Wow…! HAMA’s in first place!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Looks like our first day was a success!&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It really was… Ah, I forgot about Matsushige-san! I need to see him off!

Hm? He was sitting right next to me. Where’d he go?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, the old man? He already left. He seemed fine, so don’t worry about it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Really? I thought he had a hard time walking on his own…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku" name="Hakkei">
<p class="t">(Hm. HAMA suddenly rocketed to the top of the rankings… I suppose that makes sense. Everybody seemed to enjoy the performance.)</p>

<p class="t">(Even someone of my age got swept up in the enthusiasm from the crowd a bit. Just a bit!)</p>

<p class="t">(But this is only the beginning. What is your next move, Kafka?)</p>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Now that the Morning Team’s succeeded, we’re going to move immediately onto the Noon Team.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
We’re still holding our tours…but that makes sense. Time is money, after all.

We need to find mayors for that team, right? Are we holding another audition?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I have an idea, actually…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
H-Hey, Kafka! Chief! Did you guys see?! HAMA’s trending on social media right now!

R1ze is trending too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
That’s incredible. I’m happy for you, Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Oooh, I guess that means this was a success. It worked out better than I expected.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ten, how are you so calm?! Th-Th-Th-This is insane!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Shut up. Keep your voice down…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
HUH?! Stop acting like you’re too cool for us and be happy for once!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Kafka.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Hm? What is it, Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I realized this today, but…this unit really revolves around Renga. He’s like your sun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Heh.

Yeah. Maybe you’re right.

Trying his best is all Renga can really do, but…maybe that’s all he needs to shine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Everyone can shine when they’re covered in light. I think that’s the type of group that R1ze can become.)</p>

<p class="t">(The sun has only started rising. HAMA is finally starting to see the light!)</p>
