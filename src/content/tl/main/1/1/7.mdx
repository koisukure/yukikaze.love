# HAMA House on the Scene

This is…

<p class="t">(It’s a Ward 4 ryokan, which means that Liguang-san oversees it. Didn’t it go under recently?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Tch.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, listen up, everyone. As of a few days ago, this place belongs to me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…It was set up in a good spot, but still had trouble supporting itself. I thought that the tourism industry could put it to good use.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, it won’t be used for the industry. Starting today, this building is going to be the dorm for all HAMA Tours employees!

I call it the <span class="green">HAMA House</span>!

That means everyone is going to start living here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Huh? Wait, does that include me?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Of course it does. Everyone means everyone. That includes all employees, mayors, and interns.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wow, wow… I’m gonna save on my rent… It’s my lucky day…!

I can’t thank you enough for your generosity, O God, Great Buddha, Your Holiness President Oguro!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(That’s definitely an…interesting way to say “thank you…”)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I get to live in the same house as Chief? This is the happiest moment of my life. Not even winning gold medals could make me happier.
</Bubble>

<Diff g="m">
<Bubble character="Kafka">
Huh? For your information, I’m living here too, and our chief has his own room. Don’t get your hopes up for nothing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…This is ridiculous. Oguro, I said I would go along with your plan, but I won’t subject myself to living with this fool.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
What was that?! Are you talking about me?! You’re the fool here! I’d rather die than live with you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
No buts. This is an order from your president.&nbsp;♪

Teamwork is the most important ingredient in our plan. Every successful team has to know each other well. You two are coworkers now, so start learning how to cooperate.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I could say the same about him and Yuki-nii, but…I’ll keep quiet.)</p>

<p class="t">(He’s right, we do need good teamwork. I think Renga-kun and Liguang-san especially need to work on that…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Renga, do you really want to rebuild Ward 3 and all of HAMA? Or is your pride more important to you than this city?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Urgh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I guess living with Liguang is too much for you to handle… I really overestimated your abilities.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?! What are you saying?!

Fine, I’ll live here! I can’t be thrown off by something as stupid as this!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, nice to know you’re up for it.&nbsp;♪ I assume you are too, Liguang?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
And what if I refuse?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I talked to your older sister about this, you know. She told me that this would be a good experience for you, so she’ll be leaving you in our hands.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Tch. So that’s how you’d like to play?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Just so you know, as soon as your plan fails, I’m getting out of here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Alright, alright. That’s fine with me. Okay, let me give everyone a tour.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Th-Th-Th-This living room is huge! It’s like the size of a school auditorium…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I don’t think it’s quite _that_ big, but…it makes sense that it's so spacious, since it used to be a ryokan.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It’s all furnished and ready to go. Of course, I plan to have the future ward mayors live here as well, so look forward to that.

It’s a big building, but we don’t have an infinite amount of rooms, so you’ll be sharing them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
HUH?! No way, I need my own room! I don’t want some roommate’s unclassy vibes rubbing off on me!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well, unfortunately, we only have space for one single dorm, and that one’s set aside for our chief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ka-Kafka, if we’re strapped for space, I’m fine with sharing a room.

If my roommate’s not okay with it, we can just set up a partition to split the room in half…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
No.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Uh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
No, never. Not even if hell froze over. Even if God told me to, I wouldn’t allow it.
</Bubble>

<Diff g="m">
<Bubble character="Renga">
Is he your favorite, or something?!
</Bubble>
</Diff>
<Diff g="f">
<Bubble character="Renga">
Is she your favorite, or something?!
</Bubble>
</Diff>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yes. Sorry, but I won’t change my mind on this. Let’s start deciding on the rooming.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(…Kafka’s being overprotective again. Nobody can get through to him in this state, so all you can do is shut up and listen.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
We’re here to get to know each other better, so employees will room with other employees, and mayors with other mayors.

I talked to our other two employees besides Chief and Yachiyo beforehand, so their rooms are already set.

Ah, and I know that I’m the president, but I’m still a mayor, so I’ll be rooming with the rest of you to keep it fair.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Living in the same house as Chief is all I could ask for. I’ll leave the rooming arrangements up to you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Like I said, nobody asked.

Yachiyo, I’d like you to room with Sakujiro so you can learn from him. Does that work?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Yes, sir!! As long as I get to live in a palace like this, you could put me in the bathroom and I’d still love it!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
And I assume Renga and Liguang will be okay with each other?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
What the actual hell?! You couldn’t have come up with a worse matchup!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I can tell you’re planning this with ulterior motives. I won’t agree to that under any terms.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I see. Oh, well.

Then Renga can room with me, and Yukikaze can go with Liguang. We’ll have one mayor coming in later once we recruit them, but let’s go with that for now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Dammit… Well, at least I’m not rooming with Liguang.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
<p class="t">(Kamina Yukikaze… He seems calm. My rabbits won’t be stressed out around him.)</p>

Fine. I have no issues.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Alright, here are everyone’s room keys. Make sure you don’t lose them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Since this place used to be a ryokan, they gave names to all of the rooms… Wait, what?
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/assets/obj/014.webp" alt="Room keys" type="obj" />

<Bubble character="Renga">
What the hell is this…? “Dismemberment Tiger?”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“Fluffy Wuffy Bunny Loaf.”

…Hah, what a cute name. It reminds me of you, Chief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Hmm… I guess that’s a compliment? I know the ryokan was having trouble financially, but these names are really…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
The names are a little long, so we can just call them Tiger Room and Rabbit Room. It looks like they tried to name them after the Chinese zodiac.

Okay, let’s all reconvene after we’re done settling in. I’d like for us to have dinner together to celebrate the founding of the Morning Team. We can go our own ways for now and meet up again later tonight.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Are you kidding me? He’s got so much lined up. Does he wanna run this whole company by himself…?
</Bubble>

<Divider loc="HAMA House - Dining Room" />

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/7-2.jpg" alt="2" />

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I-I-I-I-It looks so good…!!! Did I die and go to heaven…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Kamina-san graciously agreed to make gyoza for us. It is not much, but I have also prepared side dishes myself.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I really missed Yuki-nii’s gyoza…! They’re the best!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Gyoza’s my specialty. I made a lot, so eat as much as you’d like, my little brothers.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Why am I your little brother all of a sudden? I won’t refuse the gyoza, though.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Heehee, don’t mind if I do, dearest big brother! Damn, they’re good! I gotta crack a cold one with these!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
I’ll have some too. Mmm, did you make the wrappers from scratch? They’re delicious.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Hmph, as if something like this could ever suit my refined celebrity palette…

…Mm, th-they’re so good… <span class="small">Even better than the frozen ones…</span>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You eat the frozen ones? I didn’t expect that from you, Renga-kun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!

I-It’s not what you think! I just wanted to know what it felt like to eat like a commoner, for research purposes…!

The gyoza I usually eat are always cooked by my personal chef!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wow, a personal chef… That’s so cool… Poor people like me can only afford to eat tissues…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…You don’t have money? W-Well, tissues are nice and sweet, so don’t let it get you down.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(…? Did he eat tissues as part of his research too?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
These would have a fine place in one of our Chinatown restaurants. Kamina, let me see how you make them next time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Of course. My secret ingredient is love. I thought about the chief as I was making them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Mrph.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ugh, just shut up. You’re making things hard on our chief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I am? I apologize. Can I at least still think of you while I make gyoza, Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yuki-nii… Let’s take it down a notch so you don’t freak everyone out…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
You really did make a lot. It must have been a fair amount of work.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I had Chief helping me, so it wasn’t bad. We used to visit each other while our parents were away to make and eat gyoza together.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, yeah, we did. That was so fun… I remember the time I filled them with wasabi…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I remember that, it was so funny.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
&ast;clap&ast; Okay, no more chit-chat! I have an important announcement to make!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
An announcement…?! Where’s my notepad…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Like I’ve said before, we’ll be working as a unit called the <span class="green">Morning Team</span> for convenience. There are only four of us at the moment, but the plan is to find one more ward mayor and work as five.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Ward 1 doesn’t have a mayor… Are you looking for one there?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I am. To find one, I’d like to hold a Ward 1 Mayor Audition.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(An audition…! I wonder what kind of person we’ll end up recruiting. I’m so excited…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
All of the current ward mayors will be the judges, so I’m counting on you.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>
