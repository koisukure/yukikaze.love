Alright, now that everyone’s here, we’re all going to log into mahorova’s public viewing space and watch _Celebrity Ranking Royale._

Let’s head in together and see how Renga does. Hmm, Ten, you’re new to mahorova, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Oh, yeah. Never really cared about it. I just made my account yesterday.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I guess you don’t know how to dive, then. Just put these little devices behind your ears and flip the switch. It should log you in automatically.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I’ll give it a go.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ugh… mahorova… I’ve been trying to stay away from it, but I think I’m having withdrawal…

N-No! I already deleted that account. I’ll be okay, I’ll be okay…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Nayuki, you founded mahorova, didn’t you? That’s amazing. It’s the biggest metaverse space in JPN.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
I didn’t do much. Just some things here and there during middle school. I ended up getting into a disagreement with my business partner and selling the company.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
What kinda avatars do you guys use? Mine’s this cool shark.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Oh, it’s a sand tiger shark. They look scary, but I heard they’re actually pretty docile.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Huh?! For real?! I picked it ‘cuz it looks badass!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Ten’s avatar is just the default dolphin… A lot of people his age are really into customizing their avatars, so I guess he really doesn’t care about mahorova.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yachiyo, you’re using the default sardine? I didn’t expect that. I thought you’d have a cute-looking one.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Haha… I thought it’d make more sense for me to be at the bottom of the food chain…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Kafka and I are Adélie penguins in different colors. Yuki-nii’s a beluga whale, which I know a lot of skaters tend to use… Everyone’s choices match their personalities.)</p>

I guess Liguang-san isn’t coming…even though I kept reminding him today.

Sorry I’m late.

<p class="t">(&ast;gasp&ast; H-He’s actually here! He’s here, Renga-kun!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Good to know you listen to orders from your president.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Tch.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Liguang, your avatar’s a leafy sea dragon… Very small and cute.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…My younger sister chose it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, looks like everyone’s ready. Let’s log in!

_&lt;&NoBreak;Celebrity Ranking Royale_ will soon be airing on the central monitor. All sealifers who would like to watch the program may head to the central area…&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel" avatar>
Alright, let’s get movin’! I’m gonna head there from the Kuroshio Current first, since I got a big avatar.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
Let’s take our time swimming there together, Chief.&nbsp;♪ We can make it in time without using warp points.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
Yeah, we still have some time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze" avatar>
If you swim below me, you won’t have to worry about bumping into large avatars.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka" avatar>
Yeah, large avatars like _you,_ who should be using the currents instead. I wanted to have a nice date alone with our chief.

<p class="t">(Wow, there are so many avatars here! It doesn’t feel crowded since we’re in the metaverse, but…so many people came to watch the show.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Spotted Garden Eel Avatar">
I heard that Nishizono Renga’s gonna be on the show today.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Pink Mackerel Avatar">
Does that mean we’re finally gonna figure out if he’s a genuine celebrity?! Oh, my god, I can’t wait!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Spotted Garden Eel Avatar">
Yeah, I know he’s got that whole stuck-up rich boy thing going on.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc avatar>
<p class="t">(Everyone’s talking about Renga-kun… I know I can’t do anything about it, but it kinda hurts to hear them say stuff like that about him…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Central Area Announcer">
_&lt;&NoBreak;Celebrity Ranking Royale_ will be starting soon! Does everyone know who you’re going to cheer for?!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro" avatar>
I suppose this would be an apt time to say this… Witness the growth of my pupil!
