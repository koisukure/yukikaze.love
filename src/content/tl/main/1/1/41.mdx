<Bubble character="Renga">
Looks like they’re starting to bud. I’m glad our butler was here to take care of them while I was gone.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
…Ahem.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, Father…? Do you need something? Wait, that’s…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Mm… I read it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(It’s my final draft for the Ward 3 tour plan… The tour’s starting tomorrow. I wonder what Father thought about it…)</p>

……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Um, so… What did you think?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
…!

Mm. Mm! …It was great.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
R-Really?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Mm… I think your grandmother would also…be quite pleased.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Ahem, ahem. Y-You…did very well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Th-Thank you, Father.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
…! Oahem! Ahem, ahem!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……

Father… I wanted to talk to you about something. If I don’t tell you now, I think I’ll regret it…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Th-Thank you… For raising me, for letting me attend school, for feeding me and clothing me…and for giving me everything I’ve always wanted.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
…? Renga…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I wanted to thank Grandmother too, but I couldn’t…so I wanted to tell you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
…Every child has a right to be raised well by their parents.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
No…

I don’t…deserve that right… So…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
……

Are you saying that because…we’re not blood-related?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&ast;gasp&ast;

Father… Y-You knew…?! You knew that I’m not the real Renga…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Of course. What kind of parent wouldn’t notice if their child was replaced by somebody else? I’ve always known.

Your grandmother knew as well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Ahh… Ahem. I suppose I have to tell you now… Mm.

The night before you came to our house, Renga—the original Renga—talked to your grandmother and I during dinner.

“Can they make eggs benedict for breakfast tomorrow? And when ‘I’ come out, make sure to be nice,” he said.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
It sounded quite strange, so I had the feeling that he was up to something. He’s always been fond of playing the most outrageous pranks.

I figured everything out when I saw you in the morning: my son had met his doppelgänger and had swapped places with him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
But… But it didn’t seem like either of you knew.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
You came to us at his request, didn’t you? The two of us tried to look for him, but we never found him. However, we did look into your background.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Th-Then if you knew that I was just some orphan off the streets, why didn’t you kick me out?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
When I looked at you, I saw the sickly, bony face of my son staring back at me. How could I throw you out after seeing that?

We accepted you as our son, and your grandmother…she thought you were adorable. That is the genuine truth.

But…we felt sorry that you had to struggle and deal with so much guilt because of the original Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wh-Why…? I took the real Renga away from you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Renga… I know you worked incredibly hard to become a replacement for him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…He’s just so much better than me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
But you’re still my son. Even if the original Renga comes back…I won’t abandon you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Your grandmother often wondered why you resembled her so much despite not being related…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Sh-She really thought that…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
She didn’t know how to express her love for you. That worry was constantly on her mind.

Here, come with me. Let’s look at those roses together.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
The special roses that Grandmother bred… They're so beautiful.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Our butler told me that you’ve been paying special attention to them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah, he told me that they were exclusive to this garden…and that they were really important to her.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Yes… Do you know what she named them?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Actually… No, I don’t think so.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
“Golden Brick.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
“Golden…Bri&NoBreak;—” Hold on, lemme look it up!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
It means exactly what it says.

When you were younger, your favorite color was gold.

You told your grandmother that it was gold because you wanted to shine like the sun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
She created this rose so that your dream could come true… She knew how hard you were working.

She would brag about you to me… About how all of your efforts were piling up on top of each other like bricks, and about how you would bloom into a beautiful flower one day.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
She…never told me any of that…

<p class="t">(But…I remember her saying something like that in the video Liguang showed me…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
These roses have bloomed as a result of your hard work. Surely, your tour will succeed as well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Why would you do so much for me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Well, let’s see… Renga, do you consider us to be your family?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…O-Of course, I do…! I always have… I really… I…

Um, I…l-l-love you both…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
…!

We love you too. I hope that comes through.

After all, we’re your family…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Father…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
I-I’m sorry this conversation went on for so long. &ast;sigh…&ast; But, I’m glad we could talk.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Father… I know that the real Renga will come back. He’s doing well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Mm… Don’t worry about that. We get a letter from him every year.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Well, we haven’t gotten them for a while, but… He always pressured us to treat you well, to the point where it even surprised your grandmother.

He was always such an impudent child, even when writing letters. Unlike you, of course, haha.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I see… I didn’t know. But I’m glad to know that I didn’t cause you any hard feelings.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Haha…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wh-Why are you patting my head? I’m not a kid anymore, I’m 23!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Ahe-hem. Mm.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…You must be tired after talking for so long, Father. Um… Thank you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga’s Father">
Mm. Haha. Mm.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…These roses really do remind me of the rising sun.

Grandmother would always tell me that I could shine.

<p class="t">(Grandmother… Thank you. I know I wasn’t the best grandson, but…)</p>

<p class="t">(I’ll find a place where I can shine and smile brightly…just like the sun.)</p>

<p class="t">(I want you to watch over me.)</p>
