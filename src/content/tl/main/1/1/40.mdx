<Bubble character="Kafka">
Move to the left here, and turn…then stop. I did it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
That was perfect, Kafka! You did awesome!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah, somehow… Phew… I only did one song, but that’s my limit for now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Hey, idiot. I fixed your ward tour plan. Read it. &ast;smack&ast;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ow! Why’d you have to smack me with it?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Shut up. You’re the one who asked me for my opinion. You’re lucky I even took the time to look at it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I gave you advice on _your_ plan too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
And nothing you said was worthy of consideration.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
D-Dammit…! Oh, but… I see. I can avoid congestion if I do this…and this way of presenting things would probably be better…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Anyone with common sense could figure all of that out. Looking at your plan gave me a headache.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I was about to thank you! God, you’re the worst!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Renga and Liguang have gotten closer.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ahaha… They’re still picking fights with each other, though.

<p class="t">(But they’ve made a lot of progress if Renga-kun is able to ask Liguang-san for his opinion.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh yeah, Kafka! I figured out the thing you asked for!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Our unit name?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
What’s that about?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
“Morning Team” doesn’t really sound that great, so I asked Renga to give us a better name.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah! You, uh, asked me to put a number in it, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah, since we’re the first team to form under HAMA Tours, I wanted you to use leet speak to put a “1” somewhere in the name. Good job on remembering.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, I see! Yeah, it’d be nice to have a new name!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I-It’s like you’re a real idol group…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I didn’t really get the “leet speak” thing, but…I just had to replace the letter “I” with a 1, right? I tried out a bunch of words, but I finally got a good one.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/assets/obj/025.webp" alt="Notebook with “R1ze” written on it" type="obj" />

<Bubble character="Renga">
Our unit name is… “R1ze!”

Do you guys like it?! Since we’re the Morning Team, it’s like we’re making the sun rise on HAMA! Cool meaning, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
If that’s what it means, shouldn’t it be spelled R-I-S-E?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh? D-Did I get it wrong?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I think using a Z would be fine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Why?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It looks cooler.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yu-Yukikaze…! Yeah, you’re right!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Kind of a stupid reason, but…I guess it’s fine. The misspelling might prevent us from being confused with other things too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Th-Then that means we’re all members of R1ze starting from today!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Renga-kun looks so happy… Haha, it warms my heart to see him smiling like that.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Renga kind of reminds me of a dog.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I totally get what you mean, but don’t say it out loud!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I think so too… He’s like a stray dog wandering on the streets…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s been saying stuff like that ever since he found out that Renga-kun was poor… Yachiyo-kun, that’s rude!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
So when Renga-san takes Shumai out on walks, does that mean that it’s a dog walking another dog?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Now Ten-kun’s in on it too…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
What are you talking about? Renga, a dog?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Tell them off, Kafka, please…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You just realized that? He’s practically had ears and a tail this entire time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(No! I didn’t want you to join in!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?! What are you guys saying?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
They say that an average dog is about as intelligent as a three-year-old.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
What?! Is everyone tryna insult me?! What is this, the Insult Olympics?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(You guys… But still…)</p>

<p class="t">(Ever since Renga-kun told us his secret, everything’s started to come together. They’re still getting into little arguments, but maybe that’s what a team is supposed to be like.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, yeah. Ten, how are things going with the thing I asked you to do?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ohh, you wanted me to come up with a signature pose, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I figured a college student would know what’s popular these days.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I mean, not really… But I asked some of the girls around campus.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/40-2.jpg" alt="2" />

<Bubble character="Ten">
They said you can make two peace signs and curl your fingers like this…

And it means “good luck.” What do you think, Renga-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!! That’s really good! It’s awesome!
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/40-3.jpg" alt="3" />

<Bubble character="Renga">
Like this?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I like it. It’s nice and simple. Let’s go with that! I want every ward mayor to do it moving forward.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Are you insane?
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/40-4.jpg" alt="4" />

<Bubble character="Kafka">
That includes you, Liguang. This is an order from your president.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Tch.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, we should add a greeting to it too! I heard a good one a while back…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ooh, what is it, Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Someone I know named Hachinoya Nagi came up with it… “HAMA nice trip!”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Is it supposed to sound like “have a nice trip?” Man, that’s so corny that it’s kinda funny.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
B-But I like it! It’s easy to say! And it’s really good that it has the word “HAMA” in it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I agree. It’s catchy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah, that sounds great. Chief, could you ask that person you mentioned if we can use it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah. I think he’d be okay with it.

<p class="t">(But Liguang-san probably isn’t on board with the whole signature pose and catchphrase thing…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh&ast;

I promised to listen to Oguro’s orders until his plan led to success… So I suppose I’ll have to agree to some level of idiocy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(That’s a relief… Liguang-san is starting to open up little by little.)</p>

<p class="t">(Things are looking up for us!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider loc="Multi-Tenant Building Interior" />

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
What? They can’t just make us scrap the whole story. That’s bullshit.

There’s no way I’d let go of a scoop like this. They already took most of the evidence, but I still got some in this microchip…

As long as I have this… Haha! This is gonna be the biggest moment of my career!
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;door slamming&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
Ack?! Wh-Who are you?!
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/40-5.jpg" alt="5" />

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast;

Weren’t you told to dispose of the info and keep quiet? Do I need to spell it out for you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
Y-You’re… Lu Liguang, from the Lurong family!

Gh… S-So this info came from you…!
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;thud&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
Hyahh!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
You have three seconds.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/40-6.jpg" alt="6" />

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Give me what you’re holding and get lost.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
B-But this is what you guys…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
One…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
Wait, I just…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Two…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
Hyah…! O-Okay, here!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Three. &ast;grab&ast;
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/40-7.jpg" alt="7" />

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Good boy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
Urgh… F-Fuck…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Sojun, check what’s on here and dispose of it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
Understood.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
And let our weasel who infiltrated the wolves know to spread the rumor that Nishizono Renga might not be a Nishizono by blood.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
…? I can do that, but why?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
If Kiba finds out, he’s sure to cut off all sources of information. Tell him to do it well, or else all of the spies will be destroyed.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
I see. Understood.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
&ast;sob&ast; Why…? You’re the one who gave us this info in the first place…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh&ast; Listen up.

I’ll let you off the hook if you just want to pick up leftovers from the ground. But if you want to come over to this side, there are some rules you’ll need to follow.

Justice does not exist in this line of work. Whatever the most powerful people say is law. If you can’t handle that…

Then stay in the light, where the sun can still protect you. Don’t come over to the dark side.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Journalist A">
&ast;sob, sob…&ast;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Let’s go, Sojun. If this happens again, I’ll clean it up. Keep me updated on your end.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;rain pouring&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Sojun">
Of course. But you don’t have to go out of your way, Boss. The supervisor and I can handle it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
No…

I sowed this crop, so I’ll be the one reaping it.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;thunder rumbles&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
It’s something Kiba and I have to settle.
</Bubble>
