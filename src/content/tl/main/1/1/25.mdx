<Bubble character="Ten">
Morniiiing. So what’s this “emergency” all about…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Man, gimme a break… &ast;yawn…&ast; I was up all night watching TV. I’m too tired for this.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(And whose fault is that?! I wanna call him out… I wanna do it so bad… But I shouldn’t…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Fuefuki-san called us here, right? That’s new.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
H-Hyes…! I know everyone’s busy, but thwank you sho mush for coming!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Fuefuki-kun, speak slowly, you are tripping over your words. Deep breaths… In… Out…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Huff… Phew… Huff… Phew…

Aum…! Pwease take a look atta pwacket!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(That didn’t help at all…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
There’s so much… What _is_ all of this? Wow… Did you write all of this by yourself…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
This is what you were up late working on, right? Let’s see…

……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
U-Um, when I was watching everyone interacting with the guests at KOBE, I felt infinite possibilities shining from within you…!

I… I just had to do something…so I wrote this proposal…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Keep going, Yachiyo. We’re listening.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Y-Yesshir! Um, so… If we wanna pull ahead of KOBE… I think this could help!

The mayors can put on a hospitality live show… A HosLive for short!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
A HosLive… It says here that they would be concerts given to guests at the end of a tour.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I think you all could be great i-idols!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Be so serious right now. Us? Idols?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Yesh! I’m a huge idol stan, so…! I think all of our mayors have lots of potential, and we’d get a ton of fans if we put on HosLives…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Interesting. I don’t think it’s a bad idea.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Yuki-nii and Renga-kun already have fans, and Liguang-san, Kafka, and Ten-kun were a hit with the crowd in KOBE… This might actually work!)</p>

<p class="t">(I’m also happy to see that Yachiyo-kun went from not writing any of the KOBE guidebook to doing all of this… You can tell he’s confident and passionate about it.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
No other mayors do this kind of thing, so…! I think it’ll be a huge hit…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I see. Since I skate, I’m already used to dancing. I’m in.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(But will Renga-kun be okay with this? He was really against the idea of “pampering” guests during our study trip…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……

This would make our guests happy, right? Then I’ll do it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
&ast;gasp&ast; Renga-kun, a-are you sure?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yachiyo worked hard on this. It’s better than anything I would’ve come up with.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Hyah, Renga-shan…?! Y-You’re too kind… To think a lowly pauper like me would receive such compassion…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
…Ah, if Renga-san’s gonna do it, count me in too. That’s what friends do, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ten…! Th&NoBreak;— Th… Tha…. Umm… I appreciate it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Since it has our leader’s stamp of approval, let’s do it. What do you think, Liguang?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…If it can differentiate us from KOBE, then it may be worth a try. But is there a solid plan as to how we’re going to actualize it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
If that is the case, I would be honored to assist by creating the outfits. People often say that I have been gifted with the hands of God. Sewing is my speciality.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ahh… O God, Great Buddha, Your Holiness, Sakujiro…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
I am pleased to receive your worship, Fuefuki-kun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
So we just need to figure out what to do about songs. Any ideas, Yachiyo?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Yesh! There’s a composer I’ve had my eye on for a while who’s been getting popular online lately…! They told me they could compose for us if we’re willing to commission them!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You found them online?
</Bubble>

&ast;song playing&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Renga">
“unlove…” It says that they’re an anonymous artist from HAMA. They’re probably in their teens and post their songs on social media…
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/25-2.jpg" alt="2" />

<Bubble character="Renga">
That’s awesome. Did they make that song we just listened to…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
The video’s AI-generated, and it has over 1,000,000 views with no indication that they’re artificially gained in any way. They’re good at what they do.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
From what I could find, they’re not active on social media and don’t show their face on any platform…but they already have an established fandom.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Um… Unlove-san wants to call…! Would you like to talk to them?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Sure. Renga, since you’re the leader, I’ll leave it up to you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
A-Alright.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nanaki" name="unlove" unknown>
&lt;&NoBreak;Hi, nice to meet you. I heard you were looking to commission a song.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
H-Hello. I’m Nishizono Renga. We just listened to one of your songs. Are you really willing to take on…our request?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nanaki" name="unlove" unknown>
&lt;&NoBreak;Yeah, of course. I’m not busy right now. Your company is pretty new, right? I heard about it on the news; this almost feels like fate.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
To be honest, we don’t have a lot of time on our hands, so I’d prefer if we got our song soon…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nanaki" name="unlove" unknown>
&lt;&NoBreak;I can do that. What kind of song are you looking for? I can handle most genres.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I’d like…something with a luxurious, urban feel. I need to keep up my image as a celebrity…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(...Renga-kun used the same words to describe the Landmark Tower, but it actually makes sense this time! He’s done his research…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Hmm, luxurious and urban… I feel like those terms are a little overused…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Um, uh… The Morning Team wards are in the most urban parts of HAMA, and there are a lot of famous spots around…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You’re right. I do notice that a lot of people come looking for a somewhat upscale experience.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I dunno anything about that, so I’ll leave it up to you guys.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I don’t know much about song composition. I’d like to hear the opinion of the expert here. What do you think, unlove?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nanaki" name="unlove" unknown>
&lt;&NoBreak;Hmm… Looking at your pictures, I think an exciting, big band feel would suit you. If that sounds good, I could give it a try.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Big band…! That sounds fancy! Let’s do that…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nanaki" name="unlove" unknown>
&lt;&NoBreak;Okay. I’ll send a demo to the email address you gave me, and if it sounds good, we can go from there.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Can we pay you after it’s done?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nanaki" name="unlove" unknown>
&lt;&NoBreak;I’m not a professional, so you don’t need to pay me.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I can’t agree to that. We’re commissioning you because we know how skilled you are, so I want you to be compensated. It’ll be easier on you to make adjustments to the song that way.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nanaki" name="unlove" unknown>
&lt;&NoBreak;...I understand. I’ll take it, then. Thank you very much.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;beep&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Hahh… That was so nerve-racking… I’m so glad they accepted!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Singing and dancing… I’ve done it for a TV show before. It was pretty fun. I hope this turns out well…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
If this HosLive idea takes off, we could become one of the top tourism regions in the nation. Nice thinking, Yachiyo.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
O-Oh, not at all…! I’m grateful beyond all words that you would listen to the opinion of a lowly pest like me who only came up with it after being drawn to your dazzling light like a moth to a flame…!

I’ll do my best as your produsher…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Mhm. Glad to hear that.&nbsp;♪

Also, Renga, I wanted to talk to you about something. Since you’re our leader, I’d like for you to come up with the concept for our first tour.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Concept… What does that mean? C-Can you tell me what that is?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It’s kind of like a theme for the whole tour.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Theme…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
In other words, what the tour will look like overall. Let me know what you have in mind as soon as possible.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Got it. I’ll figure it out by next Wednesday…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Good, I like that earnesty.&nbsp;♪ I’ll be looking forward to it. Chief, make sure to lend him a hand.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Of course. Let’s figure this out together, Renga-kun!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Also… <span class="small">Sakujiro.</span>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
<p class="small">Yes, Mr. President?</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
<p class="small">Just in case, would you look into unlove’s background for me? Keep it a secret.</p>

<p class="small">I have a feeling we can form a very meaningful bond with them.</p>
