<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
It… I-I-It’s finally done! Our study trip guidebook!! &ast;sob&ast; I can’t see through my tears…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Good job, Yachiyo-kun.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I couldn’t have done it without you, Chiiiief… How could I ever repay you…?! Would a blood offering or an organ donation be okay?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
U-Uh, no, no thanks. Please keep all of that inside your body…

<p class="t">(It took us all night… We ended up working into our day off.)</p>

<p class="t">(I handled most of it, but I wish I didn’t. Yachiyo-kun won’t learn anything at this rate.)</p>

All we need to do is rent a minibus and contact our hotel ahead of time. Can you take care of that, Yachiyo-kun?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Easy peasy! I took a bunch of notes on that! Even a wimp like me can handle making phone calls…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(All of the prep for the study trip is almost done. Since it’s the weekend, the Morning Team must still be at the dorms.)</p>

<p class="t">(Our meeting the other day went kinda badly, but I hope Renga-kun is handling things alright…)</p>

Kafka told me on PeChat that he keeps getting into fights with Liguang-san at the dorms.

<p class="t">(Yuki-nii says that he’s just going through puberty, so he’ll get over it eventually, but…isn’t he too old for that?)</p>

<p class="t">(But I kind of get what he means. It feels like Renga-kun is holding onto an old grudge.)</p>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(So floofy…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, Shumai. I’m all done brushing. Now you’re nice and fluffy.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Woof, woof!&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(H-He is…?! I wonder what that feels like… Should I ask if I can pet him?)</p>

<p class="t">(N-No, I can’t! That goes against my image! I need to stay classy…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
It is tea time, gentlemen. Would either of you like a slice of my homemade cake?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Dwuh?!

What are you wearing?! I didn’t know you were…into that kinda thing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Isn’t it wonderful? I created it myself. I thought that the holiday would be an excellent occasion to wear some of my favorite attire.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Cosplaying is one of Sakujiro’s hobbies.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I see… Well, since I’m a kind and open-minded celebrity, I don’t judge people’s hobbies. I’ve never seen a maid outfit up close before.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Oh? I am quite shocked to hear that. I would imagine that the Nishizono household has many maids working for them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…! W-Well, I don’t pay attention to my servants, so I don’t really know what they look like!

But my house has, like, a hundred maids working in it!

<p class="t">(We actually only have one butler…and I feel bad for him, because he doesn’t get paid much… But I need to protect the Nishizono family’s dignity, so I can’t let that slip through…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Makes sense for the Nishizonos. What did you bake today, Sakujiro?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
This is my “Puppy and Bear Go on an Afternoon Walk Together” cake, Young Master Kafka.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(What the hell does that mean? Actually, wait…)</p>

That…reminds me… Uh, that dog. Shouldn’t you take him on a walk? Because, uh, the weather’s nice today, so…

Not that I care about that mutt! I don’t care at all…no matter how fluffy he is…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

Ahh, well, I’m just so busy today, you know? I have all this work to do as president. And Sakujiro has to help me with everything, so he’s out too…

It would be soooo great if you could take Shumai out on a walk, Renga. I heard that celebrities would do aaaaanything to help out someone in need.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
!!

Fine, if you insist! I’ll take that dog on a walk for you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, thanks. Also, his name is “Shumai,” not “that dog.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Sh-Shut up! I’m just calling him what he is! Let’s go, fluffers!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Woof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
See you later.

<p class="t">(I want Renga to feel more at home around here, and if that starts with helping him get closer to Shumai, then I’m okay with it.)</p>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Good boy, Shumai! Did you like playing with the ball?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Woof, woof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
This is an off-leash park, so you can run around as much as you want. I’ve always wanted to bring my dog here if I ever got one.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Huff, huff, woof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Can I pick you up? Woah, you’re so light… Fluffy wuffy… I’m holding a little life in my arms…

You smell like the sun. You’re so cute…

Sorry I called you “that dog,” Shumai. I said you were a mutt, but even the pedigree dogs aren’t as cute as you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Aroof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Being a purebred shouldn’t matter anyway… I’m not even one myself…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Huff, huff!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(What’s this green thing on his head, anyway?)</p>

<p class="t">(Kafka told me that it’s nothing important because it’s been there since he found Shumai, but…)</p>

<p class="t">(Nothing would happen if I just touched it, right?)</p>

Wait, stop! You’ll get lost…!

<Bubble character="Renga">
&ast;pant, pant…&ast; He went this way, right?

No, wait, I don’t know. What should I do… If Shumai doesn’t come back…it’ll be all my fault…!

<p class="t">(I need to find him as fast as possible…!)</p>

&ast;bump&ast; Ah, e-excuse m&NoBreak;— I mean! Watch where you’re goi… Wait, Yukikaze?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Renga? What’s going on? You’re covered in sweat. Are you out for a jog?

But you’re not dressed for it. Are you practicing running away from an assassin?

I see. Someone of your status should be wary of that. You’re amazing, Renga. Your imagination knows no bounds.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?! I should be saying that about you…

Wait, there’s no time for this! Yukikaze, I need your help!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Got it. I’ll help you. I’ve never done martial arts before, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I am _not_ running from an assassin! It’s about Shumai. He…ran away while I was taking him for a walk!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Shumai?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I lost track of him… What if he gets hit by a car…or if someone takes him home because they think he’s a stray…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

It’ll be okay, Renga. I’ll help you look for him. There’s no need to cry.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I’m not crying!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
He went this way. I can still smell him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Y-You can what…?

…Wait, woah!! You were right!!

He’s back on four legs?! He’s too fast…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Hup…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(But Yukikaze’s faster! So this is the speed of an athlete!)</p>
</Bubble>

&ast;grab&ast;

I’m not letting you get away!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Awoof!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&ast;pant, pant…&ast; Th-That’s a relief…

Ah…! Yukikaze, is Shumai…hurt anywhere?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Not from what I can see.

I wonder why he ran away from you? He’s usually friendly…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Grrr…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Shumai…I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have touched the green pom-pom on your head. Will you forgive me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
……

Woof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
That sounds like a yes. Now give each other a handshake to seal the deal.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shumai">
Woof!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Shumai…thank you. I’m sorry. Wow, your little paw’s so cute…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

<p class="t">(He can apologize to and sincerely thank dogs, at least… He makes me worry.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I didn’t know you could run on two legs. You must be a genius.

Oh, maybe it’s better to say you’re agile? You’re one athletic pup!

Ahaha, but you all look like you’re having a good time in the photo you sent me. The scenery looks beautiful.

…I’m about to go on a study trip. I can’t wait. I finally get to go on the trip with Kafka I’ve always wanted to go on.

Well, I guess it’s just for work, but…since Yuki-nii’s coming along too, I’m looking forward to it! Although I'm still a little worried.

Hmmm… It’s about our leader. He’s a little hard to deal with…

I’m not really sure how to get through to him. He seems kinda closed off…

I think I could help him out if I could get him to be a bit more honest.
