&ast;ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump…&ast;

<p class="t">(My heart’s going crazy… It’s okay. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Good morning, Renga. Everyone’s here. You have an idea to present for the tour concept, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Y-Yeah. I came up with something.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(You got this, Renga-kun…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
<p class="t">(Ugh… I feel like Liguang doesn’t even see any point in listening to me. No, stop, I can’t get intimidated!)</p>

Um, Chief helped me make the info packet you all have. I’ll explain what’s on it first.

Kafka mentioned HAMA’s biggest problem a while ago—about how we’ve been failing because we couldn’t provide good, reliable hospitality to our guests. I tried to take that into consideration…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
<p class="t">(Hm, I didn’t expect him to remember all of that.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
So, um… I thought that we might need…personalized, high-quality hospitality like they do in KOBE. And then…

I thought about something called an <span class="green">Honorary Citizen Program</span>.

If someone comes to visit, they could collect an Honorary Citizen Badge from the ward they liked the most, so it would feel like they’re connected to that ward… Something like that.

I want people to feel like HAMA is their second home…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I see. It says here that guests can choose their ward after the trip.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah, I think it’ll be more fun if they can choose after seeing all of the wards, and if they wanna become an honorary citizen of every ward, they might come visit again.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…That’s true. The badges could become a sort of collectable.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Calling them honorary citizens lets them know that this is a home they can come back to… That’s what I think…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I remember him saying in his weekly report that Koharu-san left an impression on him. That must be why he’s bringing up the “second home” thing…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Um… Does anyone have any questions?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
This Honorary Citizen Program won’t cost a lot to implement, which puts it in the realm of possibility for us. But how do you plan to turn people into repeat visitors?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…I think we could provide direct hospitality like they do in KOBE.

There are limits to that, so Yachiyo’s HosLive idea will give people something special to remember HAMA by!

I think… No, I _know_ that we can do this and show our guests something amazing!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I see. So your concept is “to make HAMA feel like a second home.” Mm, it’s nice and easy to understand.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…! Really?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
If we implement this program, it’ll be easy for us to see which wards’ plans have the highest approval ratings among guests, and we can use that data to figure out what we can improve on.

Next, we need to work out the specifics about the HosLive performance and each ward’s tour plan… But I think we can go with this concept for now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I agree. It’s a good place to start for our first tour.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
No one can come up with ‘em quite like you, Renga-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
W-W-What do you think, L-Liguang?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast; It’s good enough. We can give it a try.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…!!

<p class="t">(I did it… I got past the tallest hurdle here…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

<p class="t">(This won’t change the plan. Whatever ideas for the tour there are, it won’t make a significant difference.)</p>

<p class="t">(Well…)</p>

<p class="t">(I suppose I _am_ surprised that his idea is at least respectable.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Now that we’ve decided on our concept, we just need each ward mayor to think about what they want to do for their tour…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Huh, for real? Does that mean I have to figure out stuff for Ward 1?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Of course you do, Ten. Do your work. You’re getting paid, after all.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Seriously? Fine, guess I have to.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ten, I can help if you’re having a hard time…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Nice, you’re the best, Renga-san. If I get stuck, I’ll let you know.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
We also need to start procuring vocal lessons for the live show, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Excuse me, Mr. President. unlove has sent us a demo of the song for the live concert.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
…!! L-Let’s listen! Let’s give it a listen!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Yes, of course, I have prepared a player for that occasion. Without further ado, click.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wow… It sounds so classy!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
This song… You can’t _not_ dance to it!! I’ll come up with a choreography!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It’s more legitimate than I expected. Mm, I like it.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I think all of our guests will love it. But…dancing…?)</p>

<p class="t">(Kafka doesn’t really have a lot of stamina, so I’m worried about him…)</p>

…Hey.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Renga-kun! What’s up?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…I have my weekly report.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, thanks! By the way, your presentation today was really good. You worked really hard, and I’m sure everyone could tell.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Uh, no, I mean, of course I did… But…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Hm?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Never mind. I talked about it on the tape, so you’ll hear it there.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, you did? Okay, I can pla&NoBreak;—

<Bubble character="Renga">
Woah, not right now! Are you kidding me?! I’m still standing here!

<Bubble mc>
Huh? I-I’m sorry…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Uh, I’m gonna go. G-G-G… Good night!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Good night…

<p class="t">(What was that about? Did he talk about something embarrassing in it? Well, I guess I can listen to it now that he’s not here.)</p>

<p class="t">(Huh, he sounds so serious… Is it something important?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga" hidden>
&lt;&NoBreak;Sorry I couldn’t tell you earlier. Uh…&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;…Th-Thank you.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga" hidden>
&lt;&NoBreak;Phew… I finally said it. I’ve been wanting to say it for a while, but I kept getting nervous.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;You helped me make the presentation and the info packet, so…I really appreciate it.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;I don’t wanna regret not saying anything like I did with my grandmother. Sorry that I had to tell you like this, but I’m glad I could say it.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;Thank you. Thank you so much. I’ll keep working hard so I can tell you again. I’ll work harder at my studying and at being mayor.&NoBreak;&gt;

Renga-kun… Wow, I’m just so overwhelmed right now…

<p class="t">(For the longest time, I thought he was short-tempered and hard to deal with, but I was completely wrong.)</p>

<p class="t">(There are a lot of technical things he’s not good at, but he tries his best at everything he does. He’s a really good person.)</p>

<p class="t">(Renga-kun is working hard. I need to do everything I can too!)</p>
