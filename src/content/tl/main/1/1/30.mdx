<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Mm, they look good. Now to line the first batch in the steamer…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, Yuki-nii, are you making shumai? I can help!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thanks. The more help I get, the better.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You always make the best shumai. I remember when we used to make them together.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Me too. Those are precious memories that fill my life with color.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ahaha, geez, you’re always exaggerating things like that. But still…your gyoza and shumai are so good—I wish our guests could taste them too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Hm? Is something going on? He doesn’t usually pull sad faces like that…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I actually have something I’d like to talk about with the Morning Team. Can we meet up after dinner?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
O-Okay…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
You wanted to talk, Yukikaze-san? Are you gonna invite us to an ice show?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You usually don’t do this kind of thing… B-But if you’re looking for advice, I can try and help!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Are you sure you’d like to talk while Oguro’s still in the hospital?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I told Kafka on the phone earlier. I wanted everyone to take a look at this…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
“Ward 2 First Tour Proposal…?”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wait, you’re done with it already?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Wow, athletes are fast at everything, I guess.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
No… My dad made this.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Your…father?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ah, I know him. He used to be a figure skater, but now he’s your coach, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…To tell you all the truth, everything I’ve done as mayor up until this point was my dad’s work. He’s always been the one to write up these documents, and I’ve just been using them as-is.

Since my dad’s generation, members of my family have only become mayors at the request of the JPN Skating Federation. Their goal is to improve the image of figure skating.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I see. Their reasoning makes sense. I’ve heard rumors that doing well as mayor increases your chances of being chosen as a representative athlete[^1] by the federation.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Right. They offer you a lot of support… But I’ve been working hard because I want to be chosen as a rep based on my own abilities.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I was watching your tournament records the other day… J-Just ‘cuz I was bored! I was kinda curious, so I watched all of them. I think you’re good enough to make it even if you don’t do anything as mayor.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thanks, Renga. You’re very kind.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
K-Ki…! No, like, I didn’t mean it like that…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
So I assume the reason why you’re bringing this up is because you want to change the policies that have been used up until this point?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…My dad thinks that I should devote my whole life to skating. He always told me that it didn’t matter if my mayoral work was poor as long as I did well at skating. I just went along with it.

But…when I see Kafka working harder than his body will allow him to and Renga doing whatever he can to help…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh, me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah. All of you put in a lot of work, and seeing that made me realize that I can’t just keep doing everything my dad tells me to do.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…W-Wait, hold on. You’re not quitting, are you…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(&ast;gasp&ast; That could be it…! I feel like skating is more important to Yuki-nii than being mayor…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
No, I’m not. Moving forward, I’d like to come up with my own ideas for providing hospitality and do my work myself.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh, okay. That’s good…

Don’t scare us like that!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Haha, I’m sorry about that. You must really care about me, Renga.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
W-W-Well, that’s…!

That’s because you’re…reliable…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I hate to agree with this idiot, but I also think you’re good to have around.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?! What does me being an idiot have to do with anything?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Same. I’d kinda miss eating your gyoza and shumai for dinner.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…To be honest, it doesn’t end there. Even during skating practice, I have to do everything my dad tells me to. I’ve been feeling restricted… I wish I had more freedom.

But he’s pretty stubborn. He’s the type to think that his methods are the only ones that’ll work. He has the final say on a lot of things within our family.

I… I know I’m in my 20s now, but I finally want to try being rebellious… I wanted to let all of you know that so I don’t give up halfway.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Oh, I see…

Yeah, my family’s been running their sushi restaurant for a really long time, so I kinda know what it feels like to be held back by them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Family matters… It _is_ true that they push a lot of obligations on you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
If that’s what you want to do, I’ll support you, Yukikaze. I fought with my grandmother a lot too. Even though she was right most of the time…

But you said you wanna take things into your own hands… I know how that feels.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Mm. Thank you, my little brothers.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(If Kafka were here, he’d reply with “we’re not your little brothers,” but they’re all letting it pass today.)</p>

<p class="t">(I had no idea that Yuki-nii was going through all of this with Uncle Sadayuki. But it makes sense; I know how strict he is…)</p>

<p class="t">(Is there anything I can do to help…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider loc="HAMA House - Single Dorm" />

<Bubble mc>
I’m happy to hear that everyone wants to support you, Yuki-nii.

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah. I’m glad that I got to talk about it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…You’re planning on talking to Uncle Sadayuki about it, right? Will you be okay? He’s tough to talk to.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
If I don’t confront him directly, he’ll probably just brush me off, and that’ll be the end of it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
So…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
There’s something I want to try… Would you help me with it?
