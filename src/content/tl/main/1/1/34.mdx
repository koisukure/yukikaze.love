…Never…

I’ll never forgive you for trampling on my innocent brethren!

Even if my fangs wear away, I will chase you to the ends of the earth to tear you and your blasted kinsmen to shreds!

I swear on my life that I will make you face the pain and harrowing despair that I have felt ten, nay, one hundred times over…!

It’s obviously number two. It smells completely different.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh…?! It’s not number one?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Excellent answer, Mr. President. The premium tea is number two. Number one is sold at the supermarket for 100 yen per pack.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Whaaat? Number one tasted the best to my pauper taste buds… Maybe God made it so only the poor could drink it…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
D-Don’t say that! I thought that one tasted pretty good too…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast;

<p class="t">(No wonder it was so noisy in here. Why is he still doing this? There’s no point…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, Liguang…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
What is it? Why are you staring at me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I wasn’t doing that!

…Hey, Liguang. Listen…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You did a tea tasting competition at your place when you were a kid, right? I heard you got all of the questions right, and the adults thought you were amazing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I don’t remember any of that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
W-Well, it happened! So…c-c-c-could you, um…give me some tips…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Hey, hold on! Don’t just ignore me! &ast;grab&ast;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…What? Don’t grab onto my clothes.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Watch.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
The show! Watch the show! Just do it…

If nobody’s else is gonna watch it, I at least want you to!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

Tch, like hell I will.

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh, there you are, Chief… Here’s my weekly report. Sorry, I mainly just talked about practicing for the show.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Thanks! That’s totally fine. Sorry, were you looking for me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah… I didn’t know we had this kinda place here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I just wanted to get some fresh air. Oh, do you want some coffee, Renga-kun? I’ll pour a cup for you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Are you sure? Th-Tha…

Thank you!!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s still a little nervous to say it, but I’m glad that he’s giving it his all!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble mc>
Phew… So you’re gonna be on _Celebrity Ranking Royale_ tomorrow. It’s gonna be aired live, that’s kinda scary.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah… No, I mean, I don’t really think so…

…No, I do. I’m really nervous. So…th-thank you for the coffee.

Well… I _am_ worried, but I also kinda feel ready for it. I’ve worked harder for this than I have for anything else in my life… I can finally get about 90% of Sakujiro’s questions right.

So even if I lose, I don’t feel like I’ll regret anything.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s really put in the work… Now that I look at him, he actually seems kinda calm about this.)</p>

<p class="t">(It must be because he’s grown so much.)</p>

We’ll all be watching from mahorova! You’re gonna do amazing!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Haha… Thanks. I don’t think Liguang’s gonna watch, though.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Don’t worry! I promise I’ll make him watch, even if I have to scruff him like a cat!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah… Y’know, you say some weird things sometimes.

…When I was training under Sakujiro, it reminded me of when my grandmother made me take etiquette lessons when I was a kid.

I couldn’t keep up with them, so they kicked me out halfway through, but…I wondered if my grandmother would be happy if I did well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Renga-kun…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, but now it feels like I get to try again, which is great. I wanna get closer to becoming the Nishizono Renga that my grandmother wanted me to be… Nothing would make me happier.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……

I think Reika-san was happy with you just the way you were. But…I’m sure she’d be really proud of who you’ve become.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah. That’d be nice.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…What kind of person was Reika-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Hmm… She was strict. She was nice when I first met her, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(“First met her?” So she wasn’t always living with him?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
We’d always get into arguments. I think that never being acknowledged made me more stubborn. I basically stopped talking to her for a few years before she passed.

Do you remember the thing with our suitcases at the airport?

That day, I was rushing home from some work overseas because I heard that she wasn’t doing well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(…! That makes sense. I guess that’s why he was in such a hurry.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I went straight to the hospital, but…she had already lost consciousness. When my father told me just how bad her condition was, my mind went completely blank.

…They told me that she might still be able to hear and encouraged me to say something to her, but I just couldn’t.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
My grandmother was strict and strong, and she always had perfect posture… But when I saw her in the hospital, she was so small and frail… I didn’t even recognize her…

…I was scared.

I wanted to tell her so much. “Thank you,” “I’m happy you were around to raise me,” “I’m sorry I couldn’t meet your expectations…”

…But I couldn’t work up the courage. So I left the room and sat down in the hallway.

If I could go back in time, I’d run up to her and say all of it… I’d tell her “thank you, I’m sorry… I love you.”

“I regret being such a bad grandson.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Maybe it’s presumptuous for me to say this but… I think I understand.)</p>

<p class="t">(I remember when I was close to losing Kafka a long time ago, and I couldn’t say anything, either…)</p>

…Everyone knows that all life comes to an end and that we need to say goodbye someday, but we tend to forget that while we’re still alive.

It’d be great if we could all live without regrets, but…that’s really hard to do.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Yeah.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I almost lost Kafka once. That made me realize that no amount of science and technology could preserve a human life forever.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Kafka almost…? I see. It’s good that he’s doing okay now.

You know… I’m not really on good terms with my father either. But I don’t want that to lead to more regrets.

So…when the game show’s over, I’m gonna tell him how I feel.

There’s a lot of stuff that I never was able to say to him…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Mhm! That’s a great idea!

I’m sure you’ll be able to get through to him just the way you are right now. You’ve grown so much as a person.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Yeah. Just the way I am…

That’s what…I need to be…
</Bubble>
