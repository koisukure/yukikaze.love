<Bubble character="Nagi">
It’s nice to meet you. I’m Hachinoya Nagi.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
S-S-Same here… I’m Nishizono Renga. Tha&NoBreak;— I’m glad you could come in today…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Wow… I can’t believe I’m getting to meet you in real life…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Thanks so much for the help, Nagi-kun. I know you’re busy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
No, most of the time my store isn’t all that busy anyway.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Uh… I don’t know how to react to that…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
U-Um, I heard you know a lot about flowers… Me and my butler take care of this garden, but it’d be nice if you could give us some tips…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Okay. I can tell you about disbudding first…
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;rustle&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Ah… I’ll get stuck by the thorns if I just go in like this, so if you have any gardening gloves, I’d like to use them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You… You’re bleeding, you know?! You need a bandaid!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
It’s okay. I’m used to bleeding, so I can stop it on command… Hmph…!

…Yeah, can I get that bandaid?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…This friend of yours is kinda…weird.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I-I can’t disagree…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
These roses are planted straight into the ground, so you don’t need to water them every day, but since they grow quickly at this stage, you can use about a bucketful and just check the dryness of the soil every morning.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…A bucketful… Check the dryness…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s taking notes super carefully… He really cares about this garden.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
A lot of pests start coming out around this time. You’re fine for now, but it’s best to be prepared. For a pesticide, I recommend…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Roses can get sick too…?! I don’t want that to happen. Grandmother was able to make them bloom so beautifully every year… T-Tell me everything you know!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Okay. Make sure to watch out for lightning strikes, any flying billboards during windy days, and dogs that like to bite.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Lightning… Billboards… Dogs… Hm? Do dogs usually bite roses?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Those are all things that happen to me when I tend to my flowers, so I just wanted to warn you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
G-Got it. Gardening gets pretty dangerous… I didn’t know Grandmother dealt with that every day… I need to take this seriously.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Hmm… I don’t think that kind of advice is really necessary, but Renga-kun seems to be really into it, so I guess it’s fine.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Wow, famous people are so experienced and fast at learning new things. Your brain is made up of completely different matter compared to mine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah… Uh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
I’m so grateful that you would take advice from someone with below average intelligence like me. As thanks, please take this. It’s a point card for my shop. You can get a free bouquet with it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh… I don’t really get it, but th… Th-Tha… &ast;cough, cough&ast; I’m also grateful.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Th-Th&NoBreak;— Tha… &ast;cough&ast; I owe you one. For introducing me to Nagi…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
No problem. I did promise you, after all. And thanks for the tea. It’s really good. Sucks that Nagi couldn’t have any.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You think it’s good?! Our butler prepared it—he makes the best tea ever. I wish Nagi could’ve had some, but…

He’s busy with his job, so I didn’t wanna keep him here too long… I’ll bring him some when I go visit him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wow… Renga-kun wants to visit him… I never would’ve expected that.)</p>

<p class="t">(You can see the entire rose garden from this gazebo. It must be so pretty with everything in bloom.)</p>

Oh, yeah, thanks for submitting the weekly report tape! I gave it a listen, and it was really good.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…R-Really? I’ve never done anything like that before, so I don’t think I did all that well…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Not at all. You spoke nice and calmly, so it was really easy to understand.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
……

Um… Can I ask you for some advice on something?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…! Of course!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
It’s about these…

Ever since we came back from the trip, I’ve been…studying…about the tourism industry… I’ve been learning some foreign languages too.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/assets/obj/021.webp" alt="Textbooks and notebook" type="obj" />

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m not really good at this. I always forget things even if I write them down a whole bunch… I just can’t remember anything… So I was wondering if you had some pointers.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Can I take a look at your notes?

<p class="t">(Wow, he rewrites things so much. Over and over…)</p>

<p class="t">(I can tell he’s working really hard.)</p>

<p class="t">(It must be really tough to do this much work but not be able to remember anything. We have translator apps, so he doesn’t need to know any foreign languages, but…)</p>

Let me see… When I have trouble remembering vocab, I try to connect them to stories. How about you try that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Stories…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah. For example… Ah, this word, _“complete.”_ It can mean when something’s done or when it’s perfect, so…

One time, I was planning on bringing my guests to a place with nice scenery during a tour overseas, but the path there was in really bad shape and kind of secluded, so I went there beforehand to scope it out.

The place was famous for its beautiful sunrises, so I got there in the evening and spent the night there so I could see it, but since I was on top of a mountain, it was, like, -20°C at night…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
N-Negative 20?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Most of the country is pretty warm, so I didn’t think it would be so bad and just went in regular hiking gear, but I seriously thought I was gonna freeze to death.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
So what’d you do…? W-Were you okay…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It was hard, but the sunrise was so gorgeous! It made me forget all about the cold.

The word that came into my mind at the time was _“complete.”_

_“My life is complete!”_ I had the thought that my life was perfected by the view.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…You have some crazy life stories to tell. _“Complete,”_ huh? Yeah, I don’t think I’d ever forget that either.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Even if you encounter hard times during your trips, they become good memories when you look back on them. I really love that about traveling.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I see… I haven’t really traveled all that much, so I guess I have stuff to learn there too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Do you take all of your notes by hand? Have you tried to watch some videos or use some apps to study?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Y-You can do that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah. Here, you can find some videos on this site. They explain things about the tourism industry really well. It helped me out a lot when I was going for my tour guide certification.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
“Dazzle…” I thought that it was just a site for uploading photos, but I guess they have videos too…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
If you wanna learn English, it can give you an analysis so you can find out the studying style that works best for you. Here, try putting in your strengths and weaknesses.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;ding&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, see? They recommend you to use videos to learn!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ohh… I didn’t know about all of this. I thought there was only one real way to learn things…

People told me that I should be good at studying because I’m a Nishizono. If I knew I could do all of this, high school would’ve been easier…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Renga-kun looks a little sad… I wonder if he thought about his grandmother and started regretting things again…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
&ast;sigh&ast;

I, uh, appreciate you telling me about this! I’ll try my best to study up…

So if you’re okay with it…can I ask you for help again sometime?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
&ast;gasp&ast;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I know it sounds kinda pathetic, so I’m embarrassed to say it, but you already know that I’m bad at stuff…so it’s easy to ask you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I’d love to help! Ask me anytime! That’s what I’m here for.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Th&NoBreak;— Tha… Ugh… I owe you one.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s getting all shy… Maybe it’s kind of rude to say, but he really is just like a puppy.)</p>

<p class="t">(Renga-kun’s changed so much. Now that he’s more honest…I know our tour will be a success.)</p>

<p class="t">(And when that happens, I know Reika-san will be smiling at us from heaven…!)</p>

Oh… O-O-O-Oh, my god! I-I-I did it!! Fuefuki Yachiyo’s magnum opus! My life’s greatest achievement…!!!!

Oh no, just thinking about it gives me chills…

This will succeed… It will… I know it will…!!
