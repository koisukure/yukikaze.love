<p class="t">(Liguang-san put in a lot of work to renew Chinatown! He was able to leave in all of its previous cultural elements while making it look so gorgeous and colorful!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Hm, I was planning on having lunch here, but after eating the shumai, I’m quite full.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Would you like to get a piece of flower word art, then? It makes for a great souvenir!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Flower word art…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It’s a form of Chinese traditional art. It’s been in practice for over 2000 years. You can tell them any word you like, and they’ll write it using colorful flowers and animals. It’s used as a lucky charm.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Hohh… I’ve never seen that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It’s very beautiful, so I’d love to join you! Right this way!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist A">
Wow… They painted my name so beautifully! I didn’t even know this was a thing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist B">
I asked them to write my mom’s name. I’m going to give it to her when I get home!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(It’s more crowded than I expected. I assume this was integrated as a cultural experience.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Liguang-san said that he doesn’t really like to rely on selling lucky charms and stuff to attract guests, but…)</p>

<p class="t">(He can put aside his own tastes for the sake of business. He’s such a good manager.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Oh, you work at my brother’s company, right? Welcoooome! I can paint your word art for you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You’re Liguang-san’s little sister, right? Um… Linxing-san, was it?

<p class="t">(I remember that she stopped by the office asking how she could help out with the tour. I didn’t know she’d be writing flower word art!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Liguang’s out making the rounds. He’ll be back real soon, so I hope you enjoy my word art in the meantime!

What do you want me to write, mister? If you have no ideas, I recommend you use your own name or your fave’s name!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
“Fave…?” Hmm… W-Well, then I would like to request “Ward Eight,” if that is quite alright.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Lixing">
“Ward Eight?” That’s a weird one. But okay, I got it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
O-Oooh… Is that a bird? I see flowers and koi fish as well. Y-You paint so quickly, young lady!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(It’s gorgeous when it’s finished, but being able to watch it be painted is even better!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;crowd clamoring&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble mc>
Hm? What’s going on?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Ah, Chief. Are you on observation duty?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, Nayuki-kun. Something seems to be going on…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Yes, more guests came here than we expected. I came to ask about increasing the number of flower word artists.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/45-2.jpg" alt="2" />

<Bubble character="Liguang">
What’s wrong, Kitakata? I thought you were in charge of watching the numbers for the guests.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Oh, welcome back, Liguang!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
You’re back, Lu-san. That’s good.

Some guests who have already received their art pieces wanted to come back for another one. We weren’t able to keep up…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……

If we try to keep up with them now, our quality of service will suffer. Give the guests who want a second piece a ticket to come back tomorrow to pick it up.

If that angers the crowd, I’ll explain the situation to them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
I see. That’s a good idea. We can check who’s already gotten a piece from the app, so let’s go with that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(That was so fast…! They’re both so capable that they cleared up the issue in no time at all.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Kitakata, who is that holding onto you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Lost Girl">
…Your hair’s so pretty…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
She’s lost. We’ve sent out an alert to everyone in the area, so her parents should be coming to get her soon.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I see. You can handle the tickets for the word art. Leave the girl to me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Sounds good, thank you. I’ll work with Sojun-san outside.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Lost Girl">
Mister Pretty Hair, I want a sparkly drawing too…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
It’s called flower word art! I really wanna make you one, but there are lots of people here…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Lost Girl">
I can’t have one…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Ah, sh-she’s about to cry!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;sigh…&ast;
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/45-3.jpg" alt="3" />

<Bubble character="Liguang">
&ast;lift&ast; I’ll write one for you. What’s your name?
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble character="Lost Girl">
Thank you, Mister Pretty Hair! I love my sparkly drawing!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Lost Girl’s Parent">
Thank you so, so much! You’re a life-saver.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
No problem. Come again soon.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wow…! I didn’t know Liguang-san could do flower word art!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
When’d you learn to do word art? I’ve never seen you do it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I did it before you were born.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Huh…? That’s not really an answer.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
You have customers waiting for you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Linxing">
Crap! See you later, Chief! And you too, mister!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Hm. Looking at this art makes me feel like Ward 8 will improve more and more…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Everything seems to be in order here. Even if something comes up, we can rely on Liguang-san to handle it with ease.)</p>
