# Welcome to HAMA Ward 1

<Divider loc="Namamugi Fish Market" />

<Bubble character="Fish Market Store Owner">
If you have any fish, we can prepare them for you here! You can also buy fresh catches!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Fish Market Restaurant Owner">
We got fried fish, sashimi, sushi, tempura—any kinda seafood you want!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Wow… It’s so lively. And you can smell seafood everywhere.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(Hm. So they specialize in seafood here? Lucky for me, I have the fish that I just caught.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Matsushige-san, they don’t look busy over there. Let’s have them cook up your fish.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
O-Oh, that sounds lovely…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Yooo, Chief. Hope work’s goin’ well. Hey, switch with me for a bit.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Manager Daniel?! Ah, I forgot that you’re helping Ward 1… Are you fileting fish?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Yeah, but Ten left, and now I gotta do three times the work. It’s crazy! Want me to cut up your fish for you, old man?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Hey! He’s our guest, don’t call him that!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(What an unpleasant attitude. I cannot believe Kafka hired the likes of him. How unsightly.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I’m so sorry, Matsushige-san. I’ll go get us some conger eel tempura. It’s our specialty. You can wait in the eating space, and they’ll cook the fish that you caught soon too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
You want something to drink? Conger eel tempura goes well with some cold sake. I’ll buy some for you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Wha&NoBreak;— Ahem! A-Are you sure?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
‘Course I am. Here, sit down, I’ll bring it to ya.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Speak _politely,_ Manager Daniel!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(He speaks quite rudely, but he seems to be somewhat considerate…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble mc>
Here’s your eel tempura and cold sake, along with your fish that they fried. I’m sorry, I need to go check in on the ward mayor for a moment, so will you be okay on your own?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Yes, thank you. Go on ahead. I’ll be enjoying my drink here.

<p class="t">(I suppose I won’t meet the Ward 1 mayor. Good grief… But, hm, this tempura is…delicious!)</p>

<p class="t">(&ast;gasp&ast; I cannot be swayed by some measly tempura… Gh, but the sake is good as well…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist A">
Being able to have fresh fish here is amazing!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist B">
I really like the atmosphere around here too. We should go to a sushi place.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(I see… The guests are enjoying it. W-Well, I suppose people are more lenient with their criticism in front of good food.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Where did Ten-kun go? Manager Daniel said that he’d look for him, but if I let him do that, he’d probably disappear too.)</p>
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/tl/main_1_1/43-2.jpg" alt="2" />

<Bubble character="Ten">
Oh, hey Chief. You making the rounds?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, Ten-kun! Where were you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Hm? I went to the bathroom.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
There aren’t any in that direction… Come on, we need to go back!
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Ten, you’re finally here. C’mon, let’s switch places. It’s my turn to slack off.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Manager Daniel.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Whaaat? Don’t glare at me like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I wasn’t slacking. I was just taking a little break.

I’ve been working hard as of late, so I just thought it’d be a good idea to take a breather.

<p class="t">(If I don’t balance things out, I’m gonna end up helping out too much, and I don’t want that. It’s not like me.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
I get how you feel, my man. In a perfect world, we’d spend half of our work shifts sleeping instead.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
What are you saying…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Lemme get back into things.

Got any fish with you, ladies? I can filet them for you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(!! He’s spinning his knife around! How’s he doing that…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Here we go. Time for the Ward 1 mayor’s legendary knife show.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;knife swishing&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tourist C">
Wow! He’s moving so fast, my eyes can’t even keep up!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist D">
He’s already got it cut into sashimi! And the three-piece filet is so clean…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist E">
Can I take a video?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Yeah, go ahead. Makes for a good advertisement.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist E">
Even his smile is god-given…!
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;cheering&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s really popular… But of course he is. Now if only he could work without slacking off…)</p>

Ten-kun, I’m gonna go, but make sure to stay focused on work.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Alright. Don’t worry, I got my own “job” to do. I’ll get it done.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Your _own_ job…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
By the way, that guest you’re helping out over there is pretty interesting.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Is he talking about Matsushige-san? He seems pretty normal to me…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist C">
Hey! I’m gonna go buy some more fish, so can you show me that knife thing again?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist D">
I-I’m gonna buy more too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Okaaay, thanks for the business.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Phew. I’m sorry for keeping you waiting, Matsushige-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Oh, no worries. I just finished eating, and it’s so convenient that the car arrived quickly.

<p class="t">(This app they developed is excellent. It automatically arranges a taxi for you to take to the next ward.)</p>

<p class="t">(And since it doesn’t cost very much, it makes you want to visit wards that you wouldn’t usually consider…)</p>

<p class="t">(But this isn’t enough to convince me!)</p>
