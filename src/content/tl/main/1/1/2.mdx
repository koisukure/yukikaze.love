# Proof of Resolve

<Bubble character="Kafka">
HAMA will no longer be accepting the subsidy from Tokyo!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
Wh… What is the meaning of this, Kafka? I mean, Mayor!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, so you do approve of me becoming mayor after all. What an honor.&nbsp;♪ Well, of course you do.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
That is not the issue here. You plan to reject the subvention from Tokyo? HAMA is barely hanging on with our support as is!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hama Citizen A">
H-He’s got a point…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hama Citizen D">
No more support fund… HAMA hitting rock bottom…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(...Kafka, why are you doing this?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
No need to worry. I fully intend on revitalizing HAMA during my term as mayor, but in order to do that, changes have to be made.

I understand that it is a bold measure, but the first thing we must do is break away from the restrictions placed upon us as a result of us accepting the paltry aid from the capital.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
And where else would you find funding if not for that “paltry aid?”

This is not a game. This whole city’s livelihood rests in your hands. Do you understand?
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;murmuring&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’ve decided to invest all of my personal assets into forming a travel agency to supervise HAMA-18.

And its name is “HAMA Tours!”

Our company will be in charge of directing HAMA’s entire tourism industry and creating fresh, novel tour packages for our visitors. All of our revenue will act as a replacement for the Tokyo subsidy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
Hah! It sounds like something a child would think up. The tourism industry is not that simple! Do you intend to bring HAMA to ruin, Kafka?!

If you wish to abuse your position as mayor to use this city as a playground, I will not allow it under any terms!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…”A playground,” huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’ll have you know that I’m putting everything on the line here.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/assets/obj/010.webp" alt="010" type="obj" />

<Bubble character="Hama Citizen A">
Is that the president of HAMA’s largest bank?! They’re…shaking hands?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Kafka… You met with the president of the Bank of HAMA? When?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
What is…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I met with him the other day, and he agreed to lend us money if HAMA Tours ever had trouble funding itself.&nbsp;♪

I’ve decided to invest not only my personal assets, but all of the Oguro family’s assets as well. This includes our house and all of the land that we own, as well as many of my mother’s patents. This means…

That if HAMA goes down, I’ll go down with it. I’m aware that I might lose everything. Does that sound like HAMA is a “playground” to me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Of course, I have no intentions of failing. I don’t expect to take out any additional loans either. So, citizens of HAMA…

I’m asking all of you to take the risk with me to revitalize our city. Would you take the bet?
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;cheering&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Hama Citizen B">
I’ve changed my mind! He’s clearly prepared for this, so I support him!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hama Citizen C">
Good luck out there, HAMA Tours! Call up my place if you wanna work together!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hama Citizen D">
New mayor ready to go… His confidence not just for show… HAMA’s biggest chance to grow…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(The mood took a complete 180…! Kafka… I can’t believe you’re putting so much on the line. You’re amazing…!)</p>

<p class="t">(I’ll try to do everything I can too! HAMA Tours has got this in the bag!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
Hmph… At least you’re prepared. Then do as you please. However!

I will not step down. Determination alone will not net you good reviews. I don’t know how far you expect to go with your current investment, but the tourism industry is deeper than you think. I’d like to see you try.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Oh, you’ll see, alright. And I’m sure we’ll exceed your expectations at that, Great Elder Hakkei.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
Hmph!

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Thanks for coming, <Name first/>-chan. How was it? I did well, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka… I was so nervous the whole time. I’m glad it went well in the end. Everyone around me in the crowd was really shaken up when you talked about rejecting the subsidy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Huhhh, that didn’t sound like praise to me. I worked so hard too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You did, and I think that’s amazing! I really do! You just took a big risk, so…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah, I guess so. But I knew there were a lot of people in the audience who really care about HAMA and its tourism industry. They all want to take it into their own hands somehow.

Nothing will change if us big wigs are the only ones working on this. I want every resident to feel like we can all save HAMA together. I want there to be hope.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="News Reporter">
&lt;&NoBreak;Mayor Oguro Kafka also announced his newly-founded travel agency, HAMA Tours, at the ceremony.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ah, look at the vizion[^1] over there! They’re showing our company logo!
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yukikaze/assets/obj/011.webp" alt="Vizion" type="obj" />

<Bubble mc>
Our…company logo…

…I mean, it’s cute, but…why is there a dog?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Because I’m a dog person.&nbsp;♪ I thought you knew that. Oh, and I plan to find someone to make a theme song for us too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
The dog’s not gonna show up in the song, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You’ll find out when it’s done.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(...Kafka looks like he’s having fun. The ceremony freaked me out, but I think things will turn out okay if he can walk around smiling like that.)</p>

<p class="t">(I’m starting to feel it too. I finally get to work to help out HAMA…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

I’ll send you the office address and work schedules on PeChat later. We start bright and early next Monday! Also, <Name first />-chan…

As our very first employee, you’re going to be our chief!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I’m the chief?! You’re just deciding that right off the bat?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well, I get to decide things as president. Let’s make this a good one, Chief.&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huhhh… I can never get a word in with you…

<p class="t">(But I’m not mad about it. Actually, I’m kind of excited. I wanna give it a try. I think this might be what I’ve always wanted…)</p>

<p class="t">(I’m taking my first step towards the shining sun.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It’s like the sun is pulling itself up out of the deep, dark ocean. There is hope for the future.

We can let everyone know there is through our work. I want… I want everyone to know there’s hope.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Yeah!

<p class="t">(I’m sure I’ll be meeting people from all walks of life from now on. I know that there are good things in store!)</p>
