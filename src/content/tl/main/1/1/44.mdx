# Welcome to HAMA Ward 2

<Divider loc="Kamina Ice Arena" />

<Bubble character="Tourist G">
I’m soooo excited! Can you believe we get to see an ice show put on by THE Kamina Yukikaze?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist H">
This alone is worth the cost of the whole tour! We don’t need to make donations or anything, right?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Your seat’s over here, Matsushige-san. It has a really good view!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
I didn’t expect to have the opportunity to watch an ice show featuring a famous figure skater… How splendid.

<p class="t">(Previous tour plans for this ward were always quite tame. I had suspected that Sadayuki didn’t like the idea of his son getting highly involved in tourism work…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Mayor Kamina Yukikaze worked hard to create a tour plan that represented what he wanted to do. I’m sure you’ll love it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(I see. So the plan for this tour was created by Sadayuki’s son.)</p>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Welcome, and thank you all for coming today. I hope you enjoy the program I’ve made for you.

…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Ah, our eyes met. He always manages to find me in the crowd, no matter how big the arena is.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist H">
The Ice Prince’s smile… It’s too bright!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist G">
He was smiling at us, right?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(It’s starting…! This is a program that Yuki-nii put together all by himself…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist G">
Wow…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist H">
So many spins and step sequences…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(His jumps are so relaxed. It’s like he’s becoming one with the music…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist G">
It almost looks like he’s dancing…! You’d never see a program like this in competition.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist H">
It’s so beautiful… The value of this is crazy as a Yukikaze fan!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He’s taking everyone’s breath away… This is the style he’s always wanted to skate in.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Ah… Uncle Sadayuki’s here!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Narration>
&ast;cheering&ast;
</Narration>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(He doesn’t look too happy, but…he still made sure to watch the entire show.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
U-Urghh… I-I can’t stop crying…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You must feel very moved by it, Matsushige-san. Here, you can use my handkerchief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(Calm down, Hakkei! You can’t let this get to you! But…the show was so wonderful… You can’t blame me for getting emotional!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist G">
That was crazy… I wish they’d sell recordings of it…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist H">
We get to see it again if we sign up for another tour, right? Are there any open slots?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thank you all for watching. To end things off, I wanted to share some original shumai I created. Please feel free to take them home as souvenirs.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist G">
Kamina Yukikaze’s going around in his skating outfit passing out shumai?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist H">
This is a once-in-a-lifetime sight…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(I’m afraid that he won’t be able to keep up since there are so many people…)</p>

I’m sorry, Matsushige-san, I’ll be right back. I’m gonna help him out!
</Bubble>

<Divider omotenashi />

<Bubble mc>
Phew! Everyone seems to really love the Yukikaze-Style Shumai!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah. Thanks for the help.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You have another show in about thirty minutes, right? Are you gonna be okay? You’re not too tired, are you? You still have more performances today…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’ll be fine. My energy level’s at 1000% after seeing you. Also…

I saw my dad softly clapping for me at the edge of the rink.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Really…?! I think he’s slowly starting to come around to supporting you.
</Bubble>

<Divider timeskip />

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
<p class="t">(Hrmm… This shumai is delicious… This isn’t good, I need to focus.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
There’s more if you want some, Hakkei-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
Gyah, I’m not Hakk&NoBreak;— My name is Hassaku. I’m just a little old man…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
This is the second time I’ve seen this disguise, so I know it’s you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
I-I see. Ahem. I have it on to do undercover research.

The tourism plan for this ward has changed quite a bit. It used to be much more mild.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
&ast;sigh…&ast;

It’s all my son’s idea. He’s…not like me.

I think things are going to change from now on. And it’s probably time for me to step back and watch over it all from the sidelines.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
…..

We’re both getting to be that age. I’m still in office, but it’s important to learn to step down if you want to have someone succeed you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Ahaha, you’re right. I hope you’ll give my son a good review, Hakkei-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hassaku">
I’ll decide that for myself. However… I do suppose that this plan will receive a higher score than yours did.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist I">
That was amazing! I totally wanna come back.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tourist J">
Getting to eat shumai made by Kamina Yukikaze is literally insane! And they’re so good too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Hah… It sure will.

I’ve never seen our guests leave so happy.

There may be more to skating than just gold medals…
